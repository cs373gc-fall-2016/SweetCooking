Add cold butter and pulse until butter is pea sized. Add 3 tablespoons of ice water and pulse to combine.  Add 1 to 2 additional tablespoons of ice water one tablespoon at a time (pulsing after each addition) as needed just until the dough comes together.  Do not over mix.  Form the dough into a flat oval and wrap in plastic. Chill for at least 30 minutes.When you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 450 degrees.Roll out the chilled dough to fit a deep dish pie plate and crimp the edges.  (See How to Blind Bake a Pie Crust in our How-To's section.) Partially bake the pie crust for 8-9 minutes, making sure you weigh the bottom of the crust down with pie weights or dried beans so that it does not puff up as you bake it. Allow to cool slightly.Defrost the spinach and drain well.  You can let it sit overnight to defrost in the refrigerator or you can defrost it in the microwave.  Either way, it is important to get all of the water out of the spinach.  After it has drained, wrap the spinach in a few layers of paper towel and squeeze to remove the last remaining moisture.After partially baking your pie crust, reduce the oven to 425 degrees.Place the onion in a small pan and sauté with the butter until the onions are soft and translucent. Cool slightly.Sprinkle the drained spinach and sautéed onion evenly into the bottom of the partially-baked pie crust. Sprinkle the shredded cheese on top of the spinach and onions.In a bowl, beat the eggs. Add cream, salt, nutmeg and cayenne pepper and whisk to fully combine the custard mixture. Pour or ladle the custard over the spinach and cheese.Bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes	8

777	Alfajores	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Alfajores-543629.jpg	100	a mixing bowl, whisk together cornstarch, flour, baking powder and salt, set aside. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, blend together butter and sugar on medium speed until creamy, about 30 seconds. Mix in lemon zest. Add in egg yolks one at a time, mixing after each addition until well blended. Mix in vanilla and coconut extract. With mixer set on low speed, slowly add in dry ingredients and mix until combined and dough starts to come together, adding a few tsp lemon juice if needed (dough will be fairly dry, I didn't need to add it but I tried adding a little bit to the second half of the dough to compare cookie texture. Just note it will increase the lemon flavor in the cookie). Shape dough into a ball, cover ball with plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes to 1 hour until dough is easy enough to work with. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Roll chilled dough out between to large sheets of parchment or wax paper to 1/6-inch thickness (I worked with half the dough at a time). Using a 2-inch round cookie cutter (sometimes I use a heart shape instead), cut dough into circles then using a wide knife (such as a Santoku knife), slide knife along the bottom of the cutout cookie (or you can just pick them up, I just always found I get less breakage using a knife) and transfer cookie to a Silpat lined or buttered cookie sheets (fitting 15 per sheet) bake in preheated oven for 10 - 11 minutes. Allow cookies 5 minutes to cool on cookie sheet before transferring to a wire rack to cool. Cool cookies completely then spread a layer of Dulce de Leche over the bottom side of one cookie, then sandwich to the bottom side of another cookie. Spread a thin layer of Dulce de Leche around the round edge of the cookie, then roll in desired topping. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature.*Here are a few of the toppings I like to use:sweetened coconut flakes (I like to grind it a little bit in the food processor to a smaller size, which is an optional step)toasted coconut flakes (I used a bag of toasted desiccated coconut I had)finely chopped pecans, toasted if desiredsprinklesgrated white, milk or semi-sweet chocolateAlternately you don't need to coat the edges at all, you can simply just fill the centers with Dulce de Leche	24

Sprinkle the fish, inside and out, with salt and pepper.Heat a pan and add the bacon. Cook just until a little fat is rendered.Add the tomatoes and basil, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, just until the leaves wilt.Cut a sheet of non-stick baking paper large enough to enfold the fish in. Cut two sheets of aluminum foil to go under and over the fish.Place the non-stick baking paper on top of one sheet of foil. Place the fish on the baking paper. Open up the slit and fill with the bacon mixture.Fold over the baking paper to cover the fish.Place the other sheet of foil on top then crimp together the top and bottom sheets of foil to seal in the fish. Note that if you use foil only with no baking paper, the fish skin might stick on the foil. That’s why I took the precaution of wrapping the fish in baking paper first before wrapping it in foil.Bake the fish at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes.Cut through the wrappings (careful, the steam that will burst from the packet is really hot!) then cut the wrappings around the fish so that everything looks neat.

Cut the butter into pieces then add the butter, sugar, and salt to the dry ingredients. Use your hands to mix all the ingredients together until the butter is dispersed and completely incorporated. The dough should be very smooth and hold together. If not, knead it until it does.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Divide the dough into three equal pieces and roll each piece until it’s 3/4-inch (2cm) round. Try to get them as smooth as possible, with no cracks. If the dough is too long to work with as you roll them out, you can cut the dough at the midway point and work with it in batches.Chill the dough logs until firm on a small baking sheet or dinner plate lined with plastic wrap or parchment paper (approximately 2-3 hours in the refrigerator or 15 minutes in the freezer).                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Preheat oven to 325ºF (160ºC) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Working with one length of dough at a time, keeping the others in the refrigerator or freezer, cut off equal-sized pieces using a knife or pastry cutter. The ideal is 5 grams each, if working with a scale. The fastest way to do it is to cut one to the right weight, then hold that one alongside the logs and use it as a template to cut the others. Once you’ve cut a length of dough, roll the pieces into nice little balls and place them on the baking sheet, slightly spaced apart (as shown.)If you don’t have a scale, simply roll the dough to the size of a marble, trying to keep them as similar in size as possible.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Continue cutting the dough and rolling it into little balls.

Add butter to a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Whisk constantly until brown bits appear on the bottom, about 5-6 minutes, then immediately remove from heat and set aside. Combine all the remaining ingredients in a blender or food processor. Add the browned butter and pulse for 30 seconds or until well combined. Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking. The batter will keep for up to 48 hours.Heat a 12 inch non-stick pan. Add butter or cooking spray (I like to use cooking spray) to coat. Pour 1/3 cup of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 30 seconds and flip. Cook for another 10 seconds and remove to the cutting board. Lay them out flat so they can cool. Continue until all batter is gone. Makes about 10 crepes.Heat a large skillet oven medium heat and add in 1 tablespoon of olive oil and garlic. Add the salt, pepper and crushed red pepper if using, cook for 2 minutes. Stir in spinach and artichokes, cooking for 5-6 minutes until spinach is fully wilted. Reduce heat to low and stir in the parmesan cheese, then turn off heat. Remove from the skillet.Whisk together the olive oil and honey. Place in a small sauce pot and warm through. Keep warm until ready to use. You can also do this in the mircowave. Wipe the skillet clean and heat over medium-low heat. Working with one crepe at time lay it flat in the skillet. Lay a few slices of brie on one quarter (basically make a triangle) of the crepe. Layer on the spinach and artichoke filling and then top with a few more slices of brie. Fold over the bottom of the crepe and then fold it over again to make a triangle. Cook for about 2-3 minutes and then flip and cook another 2-3 minutes or until the brie is all melty and gooey. Repeat with remaing crepes until the brie and filling are gone. I was able to make six crepes. Remove the honey sauce from the heat and stir in the chopped parsley	6

Set the bowl in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Working quickly and using your hands, blend the ingredients together until they look like coarse meal with some pea-sized lumps. The lumps make flakey pies! Set the dough back in the fridge for 5 minutes.Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of ice water over the dough and stir lightly with a fork. Squeeze a handful of dough together to see if it holds together without falling apart. Add water in 1 tablespoon increments, mixing with a fork after each, until the dough holds together when squeezed with your hands.Divide the dough in half and make 2 wide, flat disks about 5-inches across. Wrap the disks separately in plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour.Take out one disk and put it on a well-floured board, pastry cloth, parchment paper or plastic wrap. Sprinkle some flour onto the top of the dough. Thump the disk with your rolling pin several times to "wake it up." Turn it over and thump the other side.Always starting from the center and rolling outwards, roll the dough until it is 2-inches larger than the diameter of your pie plate. Make sure to pick up the dough after every two or three rolls to make sure it's not sticking to your surface. Sprinkle more flour onto the top or bottom of the crust if needed to keep the dough from sticking to the pin or your work surface.Fold the dough over the top of your rolling pin and carefully lay it across your pie pan. Gently scoot the crust into the corners of your pie plate without stretching the dough - let its weight do most of the work. If you've got cracks in your crust, dab a little water where it needs to be patched and stick on a piece of dough to patch it. Slide the pie plate into the refrigerator until the filling is ready, at least 15 minutes.Make the blackberry pluot fruit filling: Preheat oven to 425F. Pour the sugar into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Slice the vanilla bean length-wise and use a spoon to scrape out the tiny beans. Add the beans and pod to the sugar. Using your fingers, rub the vanilla beans into the sugar, making sure to massage as much sugar as you can into the empty pod. Let sit for 5 minutes. Discard the pod.Add the pluots, blackberries, lemon juice, flour, and salt to the sugar. Stir well, making sure to mash the fruit a bit to vary the texture. Feel free to get your hands in there and really squish it up, if you're into it. It's a lot of fun.Pour the filling into the prepared crust. Place the pie plate in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.Construct the pie: Roll out the remaining dough disk to about ½-inch thick, and cut into ½-inch wide strips. Form the lattice top by weaving the strips together. Kate has a wonderful video tutorials here. Pinch the edges of the pie so that the edges of the latticework are sealed to the crust in the pan.Bake at 425F for 15 minutes, or just until the crust begins to turn a gentle gold. Lower heat to 350F and bake for another 30 minutes, until the crust is an irresistible golden brown and the filling is bubbling enthusiastically. Allow to cool fully before serving	8

Place chicken tenders in plastic bag and shake to coat.In a large pan, heat oil over medium heat. Once the oil is hot (I test this by sprinkling a little flour in it, if it fizzes, I start frying), add chicken tenders and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. (Note: Be careful not to over crowd the pan, or the temperature of the oil will drop and your chicken won't get as crispy as you like. If your pan won't fit all of the tenders in it without over crowding simply do it in batches.) Once browned, remove from fryer, lay on paper towels or a brown paper bag and sprinkle with a little salt if desired	4

Gradually whisk the egg mixture into the flour mixture until smooth. The batter will be quite thin. Cover and let rest an hour on the counter or overnight in the refrigerator.While the crepe batter rests, make the sauce. In a heavy saucepan over medium heat, combine the beer, sugar and orange zest. Heat until the sugar dissolves and the caramel reaches a gentle boil. The beer will make the caramel quite frothy, so unlike with classic caramel, you will need to stir the caramel throughout the process to knock back the bubbles. Cook, stirring when needed, until the caramel is dark amber and thick, about 20 minutes.Remove the saucepan from the heat. Very carefully add the butter and whisk into the caramel. It will steam and splutter. Once the butter is fully combined, add the cream. It will splutter again. Once the caramel is smooth, remove the strips of orange zest and stir in the salt. Cool slightly before using.In a small bowl with high sides, whip the cream until stiff peaks form. This is optional.Heat an 8-inch skillet over medium heat until hot. Brush with a bit of melted butter. Pour in ¼ cup of batter and tilt the pan so the batter covers the entire bottom of the pan.

Cut the tomatoes roughly and transfer to a blender. Grind to a smooth paste and keep it aside. I did not blanch the tomatoes. Slit the green chilies lengthwise and remove the seeds. Cut the ginger into juliennes. Keep aside a few juliennes for garnishing. Cube the paneer and keep it ready. I used Malai Paneer, so I did not sauté the cubes in butter and used it as it is.  Heat a pan with butter and oil together. Add slit green chilies and sauté till the color changes and becomes transparent. Add the ginger juliennes and sauté for a few more seconds. Add the tomato puree, sugar, a pinch of salt and mix well. Close the pan with a lid, leaving a small gap and let the puree cook over medium-low flame for 15-20 mins. This will prevent the puree from splashing out of pan. Mix in between at regular intervals. All the water moisture would have evaporated and the puree will look almost like a thick paste now. Add coriander powder, red chili powder, mix well and cook for 2 more mins. The mixture will further thicken and look almost dry. Add the ground cashew nut paste, mix well and cook for 5 mins. Add cubed paneer, milk, mix well and let it cook for 5 mins. Switch off flame and take off stove. Immediately add garam masala powder, kasuri methi, mix well and close the pan with a lid and let it rest for 5 mins for the flavors to merge well. Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with ginger juliennes	4

For rice:                                        Place the vegetable oil in a 7-quart Dutch oven and set over medium-high heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, celery, salt and pepper to the pot. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions and celery are semi-translucent and the bell peppers are tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the pickled pork, bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, cayenne pepper, water and beans to the pot and increase the heat to high. Cook, stirring frequently until the mixture comes to a boil, approximately 6 to 8 minutes. Decrease the heat to maintain a simmer, cover and cook for 1 1/2 hours, stirring every 30 minutes. Uncover, increase the heat slightly to maintain a steady simmer and continue to cook for another 30 to 40 minutes or until the beans are tender and the sauce is thickened to your liking. If you prefer an even creamier texture, mash some of the beans with a potato masher.Prepare rice during the last 30 minutes of cooking the beans. Place the water into an electric kettle and bring to a boil. While the water is coming to a boil place the butter into a 3-quart saucepan, set over medium heat. Once the butter begins to bubble, add the rice and stir to combine. Add the salt and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently.  Carefully pour the water over the rice and stir to combine. Decrease the heat to the lowest setting, cover, and cook for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve the beans over the rice.                                                Pickled Pork:                                        Combine all of the ingredients except the ice and the pork in a 2-quart non-reactive saucepan, set over high heat and bring to a boil.

You should yield approximately 1 1/2 – 2 cups.Measure one cup of reserved apple juice into a medium saucepan and add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, along with the spices.Once sugar has dissolved, add the apples. Cook for 5-6 minutes, until the apple shreds have broken down a little and reabsorbed the spiced juice.Divide the citric acid between the four half pint jars (it helps prevent the apples from browning during storage) and pack the hot apple shreds into the jars, leaving 3/4 inch headspace.Wipe the rims, apply lids and rings and process in a boiling water bath canner for 25 minutes. When time is up, remove pot from heat and let jars stand in the warm water for an additional 5 minutes.

Peel and chop the onion as finely as possible. Melt the butter in the pan over a medium heat. Add the chopped onion and leave to cook for 5 mins, stirring occasionally. Finely slice the mushrooms and add them to the pan with the onions.When the onions and mushrooms are almost cooked, add the flour to the pan and stir to make a thick paste called a roux. Crumble the stock cube in and stir well. Continuously stir the roux over a low heat for 2 mins to cook out the flour. This stops the sauce from having a starchy taste.Slowly add the warm milk to the pan, stirring all the time. Once all the milk has been added, stir in the stock, season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and mustard powder. Add the bay leaf and bring to the boil, stirring all the time to stop the sauce becoming lumpy.When the sauce has thickened, place on a very low heat. Chop the cooked chicken into even-sized pieces and add to the sauce. Add your veg and pour into the pie dish.Put the pastry on a clean, floured surface. Make sure you also dust the rolling pin with flour. Roll out the pastry, trying not to make any tears. Measure the pastry against the pie dish and once the pastry is slightly larger than the top, lift it carefully over the dish. It might be helpful to use the rolling pin to help you move the pastry. Trim off the pastry hanging over the edge of the dish. Press the outside edge of the pastry with a fork or your fingers to make a nice pattern.Brush the top of the pie with beaten egg or milk. Make a small hole in the centre of the pastry top to allow the steam to escape. You can use any leftover pastry to decorate the top of the pie with pastry shapes if you like. Place the pie in the oven for 25 mins	4

Bring the water to a rolling simmer.In the top pan or heat-safe bowl whisk together the cornstarch, sugar, cake mix, salt, and milk. Mix until it's combined and place it over the simmering water.Cook for 30-35 minutes until the pudding is thickened, stirring occasionally. Check to make sure your water doesn't simmer away.When the pudding is ready it will coat the back of a spoon and drizzle ribbons (thanks for the tip, Jessica!). Let the pudding cool completely.Refrigerate until you're ready to use. **You can make this stuff ahead of time**Line a loaf pan with plastic wrap running in both directions and up over the sides. This will help you get your finished frozen cake on outta there.Make whipped cream. Pour the heavy cream in a large bowl an beat on low using whisk attachments until stiff peaks form. Be patient.Add in the powdered sugar and vanilla, beating until they are just combined. Remove 1½ cups of the whipped cream and put it in a smaller bowl. This will be for "frosting" your finished cake. Refrigerate both bowls until you're ready to use them.Using the large bowl of whipped cream, "frost" the bottom and sides of the prepared loaf pan. This layer should be about ½ an inch thick. Place graham crackers across the bottom of the pan; I had good luck breaking the grahams at the "seams" to fit.Spread more whipped cream over the graham crackers. Cover with sprinkles.Then another layer of graham crackers. Then a layer of cake batter pudding.Keep layering all the way up to the top of the pan, making sure to spread and push the pudding and whipped cream down the open sides. End at the top with a layer of whipped cream. Pull the plastic wrap that's hanging over the sides loosely across the top of the cake and freeze for 4-6 hours, or overnight.Two hours before serving turn the cake out of the pan and onto a serving platter.Using the small bowl of whipped cream you set aside, "frost" the top and sides of the cake so you have a pretty finished product.

Add the  mushrooms to the pan and sauté just until wilted. Remove the pan from the heat and drain out any liquid. Stir in the green cabbage, scallions and hoisin sauce until thoroughly combined. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and let it cool for 10 minutes.Arrange the spring roll wrappers on a dry work surface then place 3 to 4 tablespoons of the chicken mixture in the center of each of the spring roll wrappers. Roll the wrappers around the mixture, folding the edges inward. Before your final fold, dip your fingers in water and then moisten the outer edge of the wrapper to seal the spring roll shut. (See Kelly's Notes.)Arrange the spring rolls in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a Silpat nonstick baking mat. Brush the tops of the rolls with olive oil then bake them for 10 to 12 minutes, rotating after 6 minutes, until they're golden brown and crispy. Remove the spring rolls from the oven and serve them immediately with the sweet chili sauce.Kelly's Notes:Spring roll wrappers can be found in the Asian section of most supermarkets. I highly recommend the Nasoya Egg Roll wrappers, which are found in the refrigerated section of Whole Foods stores. Sweet chili sauce can usually be found by the ketchup in most supermarkets. I prefer the Frank's brand of RedHot Sweet Chili Sauce.The number one rule to successful spring rolls is to roll tightly! The less space you leave within the spring roll, the less chance of it falling apart while baking.The rolls can be prepared up to three hours in advance and stored in an air-tight container in the fridge	12

Cut puff pastry into 4 by 4 inch squares.   Place about 2 tablespoons of pie filling into the center of each square.   Ideally, there will be about 5 to 6 cherries in each turn over.  Do not overfill too much as the filling may leak out while baking.    Fold the turnover to make a triangle."Glue" the triangle shut by brushing the egg wash on all the inside edges of the puff pastry but 1 inch in the center of each of the sides.  This will allow the puff pastry to vent while cooking.  Gently press the edges together, don't press the edges too hard, doing this will leave you with edges that won't puff as they should.  Brush the top of the turnover with egg wash.  Bake for 25 to 27 minutes, or until lightly browned.

You cannot tell the difference between the two, and I prefer the turkey.If you want a vegetarian version, add another can of black beans instead. Or, be bold and try some other kind of beans.Mix.Add in the mushrooms and garlic if you haven’t already. Time to let it simmer, I don’t add water to the chili because the vegetables and mushrooms release out SO much liquid that you don’t need it. If you feel by the end that you do need water, go ahead and add some.Now when things are nice and soft, take about 1 – 1½ cups of the chili, and puree it. This gives it a thicker, tastier base to it, more like the Tim’s chili	8

1067	Goat Cheese Pecan Tartlets	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/goat-cheese-pecan-tartlets-742757.jpeg	39	Preheat the oven to 350F. Spray the insides of 18 cups in a muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray. Unroll the pie crusts and cut with a 3 1/2-inch biscuit cutter. Line the inside of the muffin pans with the crust circles and refrigerate until ready to fill. The crusts won't go all the way to the top of the cups; this is fine.Cook the cranberries: Combine the cranberries, sugar, water, cinnamon stick and nutmeg in a medium pot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 8-10 minutes or until cranberries have cooked (some will have burst, some will remain whole) and mixture has thickened. Transfer to a medium bowl and set aside to cool. Cook the bacon: Meanwhile, place the bacon in a medium skillet with 1/4 cup water. Bring the water to a simmer and cook the bacon over medium heat until water completely evaporates and the bacon gets crispy, 8-10 minutes. Drain on a paper-towel-lined plate.  Crumble and set aside.Make the tartlet filling:  While the bacon is cooking, combine eggs, goat cheese, heavy cream, milk, pinch kosher salt, Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce in a blender container. Blend on the lowest setting until just smooth. Sprinkle a little less than a teaspoon of pecans and evenly divide the bacon inside each cup in the muffin pan. This will create wonderful flavor and texture. Fill each cup to about 1/4 inch below the top of the crust with the goat cheese mix and carefully place the pan in the center of the oven. Bake until the filling sets, about 12-14 minutes. Let cool on a rack for 15 minutes. Place a cookie sheet over the top of the pan and invert. Shake gently to loosen the tartlets; they should fall onto the pan.  Serve the tartlets:  Arrange the tartlets on a serving platter, cheese side up. Strain any excess liquid out of the cranberries and spoon a scant tablespoon of the berries on top of the tarts. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of pecans. Use a pair of scissors to "cut" chives and place them on top, if desired. Serve immediately	18

Drain and transfer cooked barley to a clean kitchen towel or a triple layer of heavy-duty paper towels. Roll towels tightly and press to remove excess moisture. Transfer barley to a large bowl.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Add half of garbanzo beans to the bowl of a food processor along with flour, baking powder, soy sauce, Marmite and half of eggplant (reserve remaining eggplant for another use).

Add to barley mix. When leeks and celery are cool, transfer to food processor. Chop with 8 to 10 short pulses and add to barley mix.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Using bare hands or a spatula, stir together mixture until completely homogenous.

Divide mixture into eight patties about 4-inches across and 1/2 an inch thick. Patties must be cooked within 30 minutes of adding breadcrumbs (see note above).                                                                                                                            8                                                                            To Finish on a Griddle or in a Skillet: Heat three tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add four patties and cook without moving until first side is well-browned, about 3 minutes. I like to press a disk of sliced onion into the top side while it cooks. Flip burgers and top with cheese (if desired) and cook until second side is browned and cheese is melted, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a toasted bun and serve with condiments as desired.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            To Finish on the Grill: Preheat a gas or charcoal grill with a medium-high fire. Rub the grill grates with an oil-soaked paper towel and add the burgers. Cook without moving until well-browned, about four minutes.

Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil and add enough salt so it tastes like the ocean, then add the haricots verts. Blanch the beans until they are bright in color and al dente, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the beans and immediately add them to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Drain, then transfer the beans to paper towels to dry.Remove the chicken from the oven and set the skillet back on the stovetop. Transfer the chicken breasts to a cutting board. Turn the heat back on under the skillet and deglaze the pan with the remaining chicken stock and the red pepper flakes. Bring the stock to a boil and taste, seasoning with salt if needed.Toss the warm couscous with the beans, 2 tablespoons of pomegranate seeds, the pomegranate molasses and the chopped chives. Serve with the chicken breast and drizzle the pan sauce over the top.

This is going to prevent your cut surfaces from turning brown.Next, trim the stem of your artichoke so that it can sit flat on the counter. If your artichoke has a lot of tough, smaller leaves near the base, simply pull those off.Using a sharp, serrated knife, cut about 1" from the top of the artichoke, exposing the yellow inside. Quickly, rub it all over with lemon.This step will vary depending on what kind of artichoke you use. If you have Globe artichokes (more oblong shape with sharper tips on the leaves), you'll want to take some kitchen shears and snip the tips of all of the leaves, and rub the cut surfaces with lemon. If you have Lyon artichokes, (rounder shape with more tender leaf tips), you can skip this step.Using a paring knife, cut around the core of the artichoke (the very thin leaves with purple tips in the center.) Using a spoon, scoop out these center leaves and all of the hairy choke inside, until the smooth base is fully exposed. Squeeze lemon juice into the artichokes.Place each artichoke on a large piece of foil coated with cooking spray, and set aside. Combine ground turkey with all the remaining ingredients for the artichoke stuffing, and mix well with your hands. Fill each artichoke cavity with the meat mixture, and then start working your way around the artichoke, pulling back the large leaves, and stuffing about 1/2 teaspoon of the meat mixture inside each leaf. (It's ok if you don't fill every leaf - just keep going until the stuffing mixture is gone.)Squeeze some lemon juice over each artichoke and wrap each one tightly in foil. Place on a baking sheet and roast for 90 minutes.While the artichokes are roasting, combine all salad ingredients in a large bowl. When the artichokes are done, let stand for 5-10 minutes before unwrapping and transferring to plates	2

There really is no need to scrape off the scales. And I do not recommend cutting off the heads as the head is the most flavorful part of the fish.Mince the garlic. Finely slice the shallots. Peel and thinly slice the ginger.Heat the cooking oil in the pressure cooker. Saute the garlic, shallots and ginger just until aromatic.Pour about six cups of water into the pressure cooker. Season with salt or patis and black pepper. Add the bangus pieces.Seal the pressure cooker. Keep the heat on high until the valve starts to turn. Turn the heat to low and let the bangus cook for about an hour and a half. Note that the cooking time may vary depending on the size of the fish. If the fish are large, even if they are cut into portions, they will take longer to cook to the point that the bones, fins and scales are soft.Note also that once the valve starts to turn, it is very important to keep the heat very, very low so that the water is barely simmering. This will prevent the bangus from moving too much inside the pressure cooker — this is essential so that the bangus pieces retain their shape. If the water is boiling like crazy inside and the bangus pieces are taking somersaults for an hour and a half, they’ll disintegrate before they’re done.Meanwhile, peel the chayote and cut into small cubes. Rinse the spinach leaves.After an hour and a half, turn the stove off. Leave for at least ten minutes to allow the pressure to dissipate then open the pressure cooker.Using a slotted spoon, scoop out the bangus and transfer to a soup tureen or serving bowl.Taste the broth and adjust the seasonings, if needed.

1107	Deep-Fried Turkey	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Deep-Fried-Turkey-597421.jpg	210	Rinse the turkey completely inside and out and pat it completely dry with paper towels. We mean really, really dry. (The turkey must be dry beyond a doubt, inside and out. If you’re using a frozen hen, it must be defrosted with no trace of ice and again patted dry. Any droplets of water or chips of ice will cause spattering—or worse, much worse–during frying.) Discard the bag of giblets as well as any pop-up timers or other plastic paraphernalia found in your turkey.2. Trim the excess fat from the turkey neck and remove the tail. Fold the wings beneath the turkey as if it were lying on its back with its arms, er, wings tucked beneath its head. Truss the turkey if you like, though it’s not at all necessary. Season the turkey all over, inside and out, with salt and black pepper to taste. Rub the butter, if using all over the turkey to coat evenly and sprinkle evenly with the cayenne, again, if using. Do not even consider stuffing a turkey that you’re about to plunge into burbling hot oil.3. Pour enough peanut oil in the turkey fryer to reach the fill line, which is usually found somewhere inside the fryer, about halfway between the bottom and the top. Heat the oil to 350°F (176°C). (This could take an hour or more.)4. Don your apron, goggles, and gloves. Seriously. Have the fire extinguisher within reach. Place the turkey in the fry basket and, holding the turkey away from you, slowly, slowly, slowly submerge it in the hot oil. The oil temperature will drop, but don’t adjust the temperature just yet as it should bounce back relatively quickly. You want to fry the bird until the turkey is golden brown and an internal thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reads between 170°F and 180°F (76°C and 82°C).  This should take about 3 minutes per pound, or 36 minutes for a 12-pounder. Start timing the bird as soon as you plunge it into its oil bath. Maintain the temperature of the oil as best you can at 350°F  (176°C) but do not cover the fryer at any point and do not allow the oil to go above 360°F (182°C). And for the love of all things good, do not leave the fryer unattended. Ever.5. When the turkey is done, turn off the fryer. Line a rimmed baking sheet with brown paper bags and have someone hold it steady. Carefully, carefully, carefully lift the turkey from the fryer as if your life depended on it, because in a sense, it does. Pause with the turkey hovering above the fryer to allow any excess oil to drop back into the fryer, then gently transfer the bird to the baking sheet. Cover the turkey loosely with foil and let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes.6. Behold! Carve and serve as soon as possible, before you snitch so many pieces of crisp, crackly skin that your guests become wise to you. Garnish, if you please, with sprigs of herbs and dried figs.7. Let the oil cool completely. Pour or siphon it into empty resealable containers and dispose of it according to the rules in your city. (Don’t know	6

Let cool.For the filling: Line a medium strainer with a thin kitchen towel or several layers of cheesecloth, and place it over a medium pot; set aside. Blend 2 1/2 cups water and the almonds in a blender until smooth. Pour the almond milk through the lined strainer into a pot. Gather the edges of the cloth, and gently squeeze out the milk; discard the dry pulp that remains. Add the maple syrup, agar flakes and salt to the almond milk, and whisk to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, whisking every minute or so. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low and simmer until all the agar is dissolved, about 15 minutes.

So if you're making these for someone with a severe gluten allergy, be sure to use certified gluten-free oats and oat flour.Using freshly toasted almonds in these tartlets gives the best flavor. Spread raw whole almonds over a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer. Place in a preheated 300-degree-F oven, and bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until the inside is a shade darker. Let cool	10

Set aside.In a large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter, granulated sugar, and confectioners sugar together until well mixed. Add eggs, egg yolks, vanilla, and almond; beat until well mixed. Add the flour mixture, beat just until thoroughly mixed.Divide dough in half; place each half on a piece of plastic wrap. Form dough into two 6 inch flattened disks and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Prepare 2 large baking sheets, lightly grease with shortening, or line with parchment paper, or line with a non-stick baking mat.Remove one of the dough halves from the refrigerator, keeping remainder refrigerated. Roll heaping teaspoons of dough into a finger shape. Place one blanched almond into one end of cookie to form a nail and squeeze in the center of the dough to create a knuckle shape. Use a small knife to cut a few small ridges in the knuckles. Return unused dough to the refrigerator. Tip: Because the dough puffs while baking, make the fingers skinnier than you want the final cookie to be. The fingers and placement of the almonds don't have to be perfect, the more imperfect and crooked ones will often look the creepiest.Bake: Bake for about 8 minutes, and then check on them. If the fingers have spread too much you can pull them out of the oven and press and reshape the partially baked cookie. Use the end of a wooden spoon, or a rubber spatula, to push the cookie dough back into a finger shape. Careful though, the cookie dough is hot! Return to the oven to finish baking another 8 minutes or until lightly browned.Remove cookies from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet 2 to 3 minutes. Lift up almond, squeeze red decorator gel around the edge of the nail bed, (also a drop of gel on the nail bed to glue the almond back) and press almond back into place, so gel oozes out from around the edges. When they seem firm enough, remove cookies from baking sheets with a metal spatula and place on a wire cooling rack to cool. The cookies will be fragile until cool	7

Tip: For each egg, crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk with a fork to thoroughly break up the egg before adding to the creamed mixture. Start with the mixer on low speed so the liquid from the egg doesnt splatter, once the egg is partially mixed increase the speed to medium. Each egg should be fully incorporated into the mixture before adding the next egg, taking about one minute to blend in each egg.Add mashed bananas, lightly stir until mixed.With the mixer on low speed, add about one third of the flour mixture, mix just until the flour is almost completely blended. Scrape the bowl down, and add about one half of the buttermilk mixture, blending just until mixed. Scrape the bowl down again and continue alternating with the flour mixture and buttermilk mixture, ending with the last portion of the flour, and stirring just until blended. Stir in walnuts (optional).Bake: Spoon the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the surface with the back of a large spoon. Bake 40 to 45 minutes if using a 13x9 inch pan, or 30 to 35 minutes if using 9 inch pans, or until a long toothpick, wooden skewer, or cake tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove from oven and place baking pan on a wire cooling rack to cool for 10 to 15 minutes. If using round cake pans, remove cake from pans and place directly on wire racks to finish cooling. If using a 13x9 inch pan you can leave in the baking pan to finish cooling and cut into squares to serve.In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, butter, and vanilla; use an electric hand mixer or wooden spoon and beat together until mixture is smooth. Slowly add powdered sugar; beat until frosting is smooth and creamy. For 9 inch layers, use an offset spatula to spread frosting between layers and over top and sides of cake. For a 13x9 inch cake, frost the top.Sprinkle 2 tablespoons finely chopped walnuts on top of frosting if desired. Decorate with fresh banana slices, optional.Cover cake and refrigerate until ready to serve	10

Stir until most of the butter is melted.Stir in 3 well-beaten eggs, then yeast mixture into the butter mixture. Using the dough hook attachment (or a wooden spoon if mixing by hand), Beat in 6½ cups flour, one cup at a time until a soft dough forms. Knead for 8-12 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Dough will still be a little sticky and will stick to the bowl, but should not stick to your fingers. If kneading by hand, turn out onto a well-floured surface and knead 8-12 minutes (using only enough flour necessary to prevent sticking to your hands).Stir in the raisins until evenly distributed.Transfer the dough to a large buttered bowl, turning it to bring the buttered side up. Cover with a tea towel and let rise in a warm place, away from draft, about 1 and ½ hours or until double in volume.

They may not have as much protein or fiber as black beans and cannellini beans, but chickpeas come in close enough with 15 grams of protein and 12 grams of fiber per 1 cup. They are a nutrient dense food with good carbohydrates the body needs and are low in fat with only 4 grams of fat per 1 cup. And the other beans are not nearly as versatile as the chickpea. You can makesavory chickpea pancakeswith the flour, add them toratatouille,stews,salads, makehummus,falafels,roast them as a snackand the list goes on and on.

I have lots of ideas for these little guys!And we'll start by adding this super awesome Cranberry Walnut Chickpea Salad Sandwich to the collection. If you didn't already know, chickpeas make for great sandwich fillers too!You may already be familiar with my 'Chickpea of the Sea' Salad and my other classicMashed Chickpea Salad. This one is just as delicious but with a sweet flair that I just know you'll fall in love with! I assure you that this will hit the spot and satisfy your craving for a chunky, sweet, peppery, crunchy style sandwich. Full of texture and flavor this has become my new favorite. It's a hearty salad that will comfort you and leave you feeling completely satisfied. This can be served as a traditional or open faced sandwich. Or simply serve on a bed of lettuce and skip the bread. You may even find that you love the salad all by itself without any accompaniment! I can easily eat this straight from the bowl all day long. :)Slice your celery, feel free to add in some celery leaves if you can. For the scallions, when slicing use both the green and white parts. Roughly chop your walnuts. When buying cranberries, use organic whenever possible (I like the ones from Trader Joe's, they're so brightly colored too!). You can also use fresh chopped cranberries!Roughly mash your chickpeas. I decided to double this batch using 3 cups of chickpeas instead of 1 1/2 so you'll have plenty of leftovers. And you'll be glad you have them!Add in the remaining ingredients and mix. About as simple as it gets, which is why I love chickpea salads!There you have it...serve on your favorite bread. I have it paired here with a fruit, nut and seed loaf.Cranberry Walnut Chickpea Salad SandwichIngredients3 cups cooked or 2 cans (15oz) garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained and rinsed1 cup celery, diced1/2 cup organic dried cranberries (chopped fresh would be great too)1/2 cup walnuts or pecans, roughly chopped1/2 cup scallions (green onions), thinly sliced, white & green partsmineral salt & freshly ground pepper, to taste (I used about 1/2 teaspoon each)Dressing6 tablespoons (1/3 cup)tahinior vegan mayo4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) champagne, white wine or cider vinegar (I usedOrange Muscat Champagne Vinegar)2 tablespoons water (only needed if using tahini)2 teaspoons pure maple syrupTo serveleafy lettuce of choicebread of choiceStart by mixing your dressing. In a small bowl combine tahini/mayo, vinegar, water and maple syrup. Set aside so the flavors come together. This can be made a day or two ahead and stored in the refrigerator until ready to use. Add a tad more water, or vinegar if you're a vinegar lover, to thin out dressing as desired. If using vegan mayo, you may like to add 2 more tablespoons.In a medium to large bowl, add your garbanzo beans and roughly mash with a strong fork or potato masher. Add in celery, cranberries, nuts, scallions, salt, pepper and dressing, mix well. Serve at room temp or let chill in the refrigerator for an hour before serving.Serve on your favorite bread as a closed or open faced sandwich, or on a bed of leafy greens. You may even opt to simply enjoy the salad as is.Serves 6 - 8.Notes:Add extra of anything you like, and vice versa, if you're not keen on an ingredient use less or omit! One particular ingredient may be the vinegar. I'm not much of a vinegar fan but I loved the orange muscat champagne vinegar and found I used quite a bit and loved it!Change up the walnuts, using pecans, almonds, sunflower seeds, etc. If using sunflower seeds, use half the amount called for.For the dressing, I have only made this using tahini since I do not use any kind of store bought vegan mayos. If using vegan mayo, adjust accordingly adding more mayo as needed, maybe 1/2 cup instead of 1/3	6

1335	Moon Pies	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Moon-Pies-507839.jpg	105	To Make the Cookies: With a mixer on medium speed, beat the butter until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the brown sugar and beat at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium, add the egg and the vanilla extract, and beat to combine. Reduce the speed to low, add the flour and the salt, and mix just until a soft dough forms. Divide the dough in two, shape into disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line at least two baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat; set aside. Working with one disk at a time, roll out the dough to about 1/8-inch thickness. Using a 2½-inch diameter round cutter, cut out the rounds and place them on the prepared baking sheets, about ½ an inch apart. Refrigerate the cookies (on the baking sheets) for 10 minutes.3. Bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on the pans for a couple of minutes, and then move to a cooling rack to cool completely.4. To Make the Marshmallow Filling: Using a mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the the egg whites with the cream of tartar and the salt until firm peaks form, gradually increasing from medium-low speed to medium-high speed as the egg whites gain volume. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, boil the corn syrup over high heat without stirring until it registers 230 to 235 degrees F on a candy thermometer (thread ball stage). Slowly drizzle the hot corn syrup into the egg whites and beat at high speed until glossy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium-low, beat in the vanilla extract and the powdered sugar.5. Using either a pastry bag or a spoon, mound about 1½ tablespoons of marshmallow filling into the center of a cookie. Top with another cookie and press lightly to spread the marshmallow to the edges. Add another mound on top of the second cookie, and top with another cookie, again pressing slightly to spread the filling to the edges. Repeat with the rest of the cookies.6. To Make the Chocolate Coating: Using a double boiler or in the microwave on 50% power and in 30 second increments, melt the chocolate and vegetable oil together until completely smooth. Place the assembled cookies on a wire rack set over a sheet of wax paper. Spoon the melted chocolate over each cookie so that it runs down the sides and covers most of the cookie. Allow to set at room temperature for about 2 hours (or refrigerate to speed up the process)	18

Sprinkle in the flour, stirring a couple of minutes with a metal whisk until well mixed (tan, but not brown).  3 Slowly add the reduced mixture to the roux, stirring quickly to incorporate.  When you first add some of the mixture, the roux will bubble up.  Just keep adding the mixture and keep whisking to incorporate.4 Turn the heat to low.  Slowly whisk in the butter, 2 tablespoons at a time.  Add lemon juice, salt, and white pepper.  Add some more clam stock or water if the sauce is too thick. Add the chopped parsley right before you serve.1 Arrange an oven rack so that when the fish is on a baking pan in the oven it will be 4 to 5 inches from the heat.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  2 Rinse the fish in cold water, cut into serving pieces if necessary.  Remove any bones with fish-bone tweezers or (spotless clean) pliers.  Lay the fish flat in a aluminum foil lined baking pan.  Rub some olive oil over both sides of the pieces, enough to coat.  Sprinkle both sides with a few shakes of salt and pepper.  Bake for 10-15 minutes, until just done. To test, use the tip of a knife to gently cut into the thickest part of the fillet.  The fish is done when the fish has just turned from translucent to opaque at the center.  Once you pull the fish out of the oven it will continue to cook for a few minutes. 3 Serve the fish with the sauce poured on top	4

Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, partially covered, until the beans are tender but still hold their shape, about 45 minutes.  Drain and set aside.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat until it shimmers.  Toss in the chouriço and cook until browned, 7 to 10 minutes.  Fish out the slices with a slotted spoon and transfer to paper towels.   Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of the fat from the pot, or if the pot is dry, drizzle in more oil so you have 3 tablespoons.  Add the onions and bay leaf and cook, stirring often, until the onions are deeply golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.  Adjust the heat as necessary to prevent the onions from burning.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute.  Pour in the beef stock and 5 cups of water, add the potatoes, and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, until the potatoes are just tender, 10 to 12 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            While the soup is simmering, spoon a third of the beans and a bit of the soup broth into a food processor.  Pulse to make a loose paste, then, if desired, pass the paste through a sieve.  Straining the paste gives the dish extra body without errant bean skins floating in your soup.  It's entirely optional but, I think, preferable.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            When the potatoes are cooked, stir in the collards, chouriço, bean paste, and beans.

Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to 5 days. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading. Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat or spray with cooking spray. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet) and bake for about 10 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked and glossy in the center. Don't overbake which is easy to do with dark cookies. Cookies firm up as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for about 10 minutes before serving. I let them cool on the baking sheet and don't use a rack. Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months	17

Be aware that if you boil your potato, it might end up being a little wetter than if you use one of the other methods, so you might want to add a little less lime juice or your mixture might be too wet.When the potato is cooked, mash it well. If you left the skins on like I did, you might need to use a knife to break up the skins a little. Add the chopped chilli, coriander, lime juice and seasonings, and mash together. Add the corn, and mix to combine.With clean hands, shape the mixture into four patties.Heat the oil in a pan until it sizzles when a tiny piece of the mixture is added. Carefully add the potato cakes (use a spatula to help them stay together), and cook over a medium heat until the underside of each potato cake is golden brown (it should just take a few minutes)	2
1386	Freezer Tomato Sauce	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Freezer-Tomato-Sauce-598338.jpg	90	Place the tomatoes in a large pot or Dutch oven with 6 tablespoons water. Dampen a large piece of crumpled parchment paper with cold water, open it, and place it directly over the tomatoes. Cover the pot and cook over very low heat for 30 minutes, shaking the pot occasionally to stir. Do not open, as the tomatoes are sweating and cooking in their own steam.2. Transfer the tomatoes to a food processor, in two to three batches if necessary, and process until smooth. Strain through a sieve, discarding the skins and seeds, if desired. Place the tomatoes, olive oil, shallots, garlic, and herbs in a pot. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 40 to 50 minutes, until reduced to 12 cups. Season with salt and pepper to taste, adding the sugar if necessary.3. To freeze: Allow the sauce to cool completely to room temperature, then divide among six 1-quart plastic freezer bags—each bag will contain about 2 cups of sauce, making each bag only half full. Freeze flat until solid, about 1 hour. When solid, store more compactly in the freezer.4. To thaw: Thaw the bags of sauce completely immersed in a bowl of cold water, about 1 1/2 hours to partially thaw. Or put the bags of sauce on a plate and thaw in the refrigerator for about 4 hours. You do not have to completely thaw the sauce before you heat it.5. To serve: Transfer the thawed sauce to a pot, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes	6

During the last minute of kneading, add in the minced jalapeno and cheddar cheese (add in the cheddar a little at a time so it doesnt all clump together).Form the dough into a ball then place in a well-oiled bowl, turn once to coat and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 50 to 60 minutes.Preheat the oven to 450F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and spray lightly with nonstick cooking spray.In a large stockpot, add the 10 cups water and baking soda. Bring the mixture to a boil.Meanwhile, turn out the dough onto a well-floured surface. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll out each portion of the dough into a rope, about 1-inch in diameter (if the dough is really springy and keeps bouncing back, let it rest a few minutes and try again). Using a pizza cutter, cut each rope into 1-inch pieces.Working in batches (I do about 4 to 6 bites at a time), carefully place several of the bites into the boiling water. Boil for 30 seconds, giving them a gentle stir halfway through. Remove the bites using a slotted skimmer, drain off any excess water and place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with all the bites.Brush all the bites lightly with the egg wash, then sprinkle with the kosher salt.Bake for about 10-14 minutes, rotating the pans once during baking, until deep golden brown (keep an eye on them as the baking time may vary slightly in different ovens - you dont want to burn them! 14 minutes is perfect in my oven).

This way, once the soaking is done, the sauce can be make in under 10 minutes.In a medium to large pot, saute onion in olive oil until soft and golden, being careful not to burn. Add a little salt if the onions are looking dry. Once the onion is almost all done, add the garlic and cook 30-60 seconds. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Save the pot to use later. Note: If you are going to make the sauce later, this is a good step at which to stop. Once the onion is cooked and the other ingredients are measured, the sauce comes together quickly.If you are going to use the sauce for pasta, start heating the water now. Place a large pot of water on the stove with a cover. See tips below for cooking gluten-free pasta.Drain and rinse the cashews, and add them to a large food processor or blender (I have found a high powered blender makes this sauce very creamy and smooth).Add the remaining ingredients, including the onion and garlic mixture. Process or blend mixture until smooth and creamy, about 2-3 minutes. If using a food processor, scrape down the sides after 1 minute.Taste sauce. It will be a little gritty from the starch but check for flavor. Add more salt if it tastes flat or more nutritional yeast if you want more of a cheesy flavor.Transfer the sauce to the pan which was used to saute the onion and garlic. Place on stove and heat over medium, stirring every few minutes. The sauce needs about 10-15 minutes to heat up and thicken. While the sauce thickens, cook the pasta al dente (see gluten-free pasta cooking tips in the post above).Once the pasta is cooked and the sauce is thick enough, place the pasta in the same pot which was used to cook it. Slowly pour in the sauce, stirring in between, until pasta is well coated but not swimming.Simmer sauce and pasta together, then serve. Add more sauce to the pasta if needed	8

1499	Thiebaud Pink Cake	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Thiebaud-Pink-Cake-214701.jpg	45	To make the strawberry concentrate, wash, dry, and hull the strawberries. Cut the berries in half or quarter them if they are especially big.                                                                Combine the strawberries, water, and sugar in a medium nonreactive saucepan and bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, stirring to help the sugar dissolve. Turn down the heat to the low, cover, and simmer until the berries are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the berries rest, covered, for 5 minutes.                                                                Transfer the berry mixture to a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium nonreactive saucepan. Once all of the juice has drained, set the berries aside to use in another project. Bring the juice to a simmer over medium-low heat until it has reduced down to 1/4 cup (2.1 oz / 60 g), about 10 minutes, and set aside to cool.                                                                 To assemble the pink cake, place the cooled cake on a flat, stable work surface. Using a long, serrated knife, slice off the rounded top of the cake so that it is perfectly level. An even, flat top is key to the look of this dessert.                                                                Using the serrated knife, split the cake horizontally into 2 even layers. Split each half in half again so that you have a total of 4 layers. Place the bottom layer on an 8-inch cardboard cake round or directly on the serving platter and set on top of a cake turntable, if you have one. Generously brush the surface of the cake with simple syrup.                                                                Prepare the buttercream by warming and whipping it to achieve a mayonnaise-like consistency (see Working with Buttercream). Measure out 1/2 cup (2.6 oz / 73 g) of buttercream and, using an offset spatula, spread it evenly on the bottom cake layer, being careful not to let it blop over the sides. As you spread the buttercream, let a small wall (about 1/4 inch high) form around the outer edge, creating a well for the lemon curd.                                                                Evenly distribute 1/4 cup (2.1 oz / 60 g) of the lemon curd in the well. Set another cake layer on top and brush with simple syrup; spread with buttercream, creating a well, and fill with lemon curd just as you did with the first layer. Repeat with the third layer. Top with the final cake layer.                                                                If necessary, warm the buttercream once again. Measure out 1 cup (5.2 oz / 146 g) of buttercream and use the offset spatula to apply it as a crumb coat, a thin coating covering all surfaces of the cake; a crumb coat will seal the exterior of the cake to help prevent crumbs from marring the final frosting. (It's important to measure out buttercream specifically for the crumb coat so that the unused buttercream remains crumb free.) Refrigerate the cake for 10 to 15 minutes to set the crumb coat.                                                                Reserve about 1/2 cup (2.6 oz / 73 g) of buttercream for the top of the cake. Using an offset spatula, apply a thick layer of the remaining buttercream to the sides of the chilled crumb-coated cake. At this point, it's not important that the cake look pretty—it's most important that the buttercream be evenly distributed around the sides. With the cake sitting squarely in the middle of the turntable and with the offset spatula held vertically against the frosting, begin spinning the turntable. Keep the cake moving steadily in one direction and apply light pressure with the spatula; the buttercream will begin to even out. I like to imagine the spatula as the needle that stays steady while the record (or cake) spins round and round on the turntable. My goal is to make the sides perfect before adding any Thiebaud personality. Make sure to watch the vertical line of the cake; I find it helpful to look at the right side of the cake at eye level while spinning the turntable. You can add more buttercream to any spots that seem thin and whittle down any thick spots with the spatula.                                                                Once the sides are perfectly vertical and smooth, create as much or as little texture as you want in the buttercream. I constantly refer back to Display Cakes as I try to capture the casual, slightly imperfect look of Thiebaud's cakes onto my neatly frosted sides. It's not easy! While spinning the cake on the turntable, I often hold my offset spatula vertically and gently wobble it back and forth, or I take a quick swipe at the cake with the spatula blade as the turntable spins.                                                                When the sides are to your liking, you'll find a ring of buttercream standing up above the surface of the cake. Lightly "grab" the excess buttercream in one area with the offset spatula and pull it toward the center of the cake, spreading it toward the center. Repeat until you have a nice, clean edge all around.                                                                If necessary, warm the reserved buttercream, and then mound it up on top of the cake in the center. Using a small offset spatula, start from the center and begin smoothing out the buttercream, inching it closer and closer to the edge of the cake. I work fairly slowly when doing this in order to get a nice, voluminous lip of buttercream where the sides and the top of the cake meet, re-creating the ring that appears around the top edge of Thiebaud's pink cake.                                                                Place the raspberry in the center of the cake.                                                                The cake is best served immediately.                                                             Do Ahead: This cake has many different components that require preparation before the cake can be assembled. The cake needs to be baked and thoroughly chilled before assembly, so consider making it the day before. It will keep for up to 5 days in the refrigerator or for up 2 months in the freezer. The lemon curd takes 3 to 4 hours to set, so consider preparing it while the cake is baking. It can be kept for up to 1 week in the refrigerator or for 4 months in the freezer. The strawberry concentrate can be made ahead and stored for up to 1 week in an airtight container in the refrigerator or 4 months in the freezer, but should be at room temperature before using. The buttercream is easiest to use when it's freshly made, but it can also be made ahead and easily rewarmed before frosting the cake (see Working with Buttercream). It will keep for up to 1 week in the refrigerator or for up to 4 months in the freezer. The simple syrup can be made shortly before assembling the cake but, if made ahead of time, will keep for up to 3 weeks in the refrigerator. To store leftover cake, press plastic wrap against the cut sides and refrigerate for up to 1 week. Bring to room temperature before serving.Above and Beyond: In the painting Display Cakes, the pink cake is the smallest of the three. But since 6-inch cake pans aren't common in home kitchens, I've made this cake the same size as the other two. To make a more faithful replica of the painting, bake the cake batter in two 6 by 2-inch cake pans; see Variations in Rose's Downy Yellow Butter Cake for details. Split each baked cake into 2 even layers so that you have a total of 4 layers. Build the cake on a 6-inch cardboard cake round or directly on a serving platter, using slightly less simple syrup, buttercream, and lemon curd on each layer.

Then strain both jars of the fermenting kefir into the third clean jar with the fresh fruit in it, straining out the kefir grains ( set them aside) filling the jar to a  inch from the top. Then cover tightly with a lid, and leave on the counter another 24 hours. Your kefir will start bubbling.I will tell you that these metal lids like in this photo, are not ideal. The plastic lids are best.The water kefir is creating gas and building pressure, which you want it to do - this makes it nice and bubbly, but with the metal lids, you must let out some of the pressure, "burping it" every 6 hours or so, so the lid doesn't bend open ( yes this happened to me). With a plastic lid, it stays on fine.After 24 hours, the fruit will float the the surface and it's time to refrigerate it. Once it's chilled, give it a try. You can eat the fruit, it won't hurt you, but I generally just strain it as I pour.The kefir grains that you strained out earlier can be stored in a smaller jar, in the fridge in sugar water or the extra kefir water you will have after you merge the two jars into one. When refrigerated, you want to feed the grains at least once a week, to keep them healthy and alive	8

When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, light half the burners of a gas grill to medium-high heat. Cover and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Place parchment pouches on cool side of grill, cover, and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, fish should flake and be opaque all the way through when done	4

1495	Croissants	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Croissants-473720.jpg	45	In a small saucepan, heat milk until just warm, about 80-90 degrees. Milk should not simmer. Pour into a medium bowl (preferably glass to see rise) and stir in yeast until dissolved. Add the flour and stir together until evenly combined. Dough will be sticky. Cover and allow to rise for 2-3 hours or overnight in the fridge. Dough. Measure out ingredients and set aside. In a stand mixer with the dough hook, add the preferment mixture to the bowl as well as the yeast. Mix together on low speed until evenly combined, about 1 minute, scraping down sides if necessary. Increase speed to medium and beat for another 3 minutes, slowly adding half the milk until incorporated. Reduce speed to low and add remaining milk, 5 cups of flour, sugar, salt, and butter. Mix until a loose shaggy dough forms, about 3 minutes. Allow dough to rest for 15 minutes. (A good rule of thumb, work the dough as little as possible. Overworking dough will result in a tough, glutenous, dense croissant. This same rule applies to biscuits, scones, and pie dough.) With the mixer speed on low, mix until dough is smooth and elastic. Dough should be neither sticky nor dry. Add remaining cup of flour 1/4 cup at a time until consistency is reached. You may not use all the flour. If your dough is too dry, add 1 tablespoon of milk at a time. For added visibility, transfer dough to a glass bowl and cover. Allow to rise in a cool place for 1 1/2 hours. Dough should double in size. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface or a Roul'Pat. Press dough out into a rectangle, 2 inches thick. Wrap in plastic and place in refrigerator for 4 hours. Roll-in butter. About 3 hours into the chill, prepare the butter. Add butter to stand mixer fitted with  paddle attachment and beat butter on medium until malleable, about 3 minutes. Wrap butter in plastic wrap and shape into a square, about 1 inch thick. Return to fridge to chill but not harden. Remove dough and butter from fridge to begin laminating. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface or a Roul'Pat. Roll out into a 28" x 12" rectangle. With the longest side of the rectangle facing you, add the butter square the the left side and evenly spread over 2/3 of the rectangle. Fold dough in thirds, first folding the right, non-buttered portion over. Then fold the left, buttered portion over that as you would fold a letter. This is considered a plaque. Press the seams together to seal the butter into the plaque. Turn the plaque so that the long edge is facing you again. Roll out into a 28" x 12" rectangle. Fold dough into thirds once again and wrap in plastic wrap. Return dough to fridge to rest for 2 hours.Finally, transfer dough to a lightly floured surface or a Roul'Pat. Again, roll out into a 28" x 12" rectangle. Fold into thirds. The dough should measure 9" x 12", and about 2" thick. Wrap again, but this time place into the freezer to chill for 1 hour. If making croissants the next morning, retire dough from freezer to fridge overnight. (Dough can be kept in freezer for up to one week. Thaw in fridge overnight before using.) Remove dough from fridge to form, proof, and bake. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface or a Roul'Pat. Roll out into a 32" x 12" rectangle, 3/8" thick. This takes some muscle. Using a pastry wheel, pizza cutter, or chef's knife, cut long triangles 4" wide at the base for croissants, or 6" x 4" rectangles for Pain au Chocolats.Line a baking sheet with a Silpain or parchment paper. To shape croissants, begin with the base facing you and tightly roll towards the point. The point should sit underneath the croissant. You should have 6-7 ridges. To roll Pain au Chocolats, add a chocolate baton or dark chocolate chips in a row and roll tightly placing the seam underneath. Place on lined baking sheet, at least 2" apart on all sides. In a warm, draft-free room, allow pastries to rise for 2-3 hours, or until doubled in size. The cooler the kitchen, the longer the rise. Pastries should be somewhat firm yet puffy. Egg wash. In a small bowl whisk together ingredients until pale yellow. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Using a pastry brush, carefully paint the pastries being sure to cover all sides. Wipe any drippings off the Silpain. Allow the egg wash to dry slightly before baking. Place croissants in oven and immediately turn heat down to 400 degrees. Bake for 10 minutes. Rotate pan and continue to bake for another 6-10 minutes until deep golden. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack. Serve warm.Storage. Keep covered at room temperature once cooled for up to a day. Store up to one week in an airtight container in fridge	16

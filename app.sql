Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.In a medium mixing bowl whisk together the flour, baking soda, ginger, cardamom, clove and salt.Place the brown sugar and butter into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on low speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the molasses, egg and fresh ginger and beat on medium for 1 minute. Add the crystallized ginger and using a rubber spatula, stir to combine. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir until well combined.With a 2-teaspoon sized scoop, drop the dough onto a parchment lined half sheet pan approximately 2-inches apart. Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 12 minutes for slightly chewy cookies or 15 minutes for more crisp cookies. Rotate the pan halfway through cooking.Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to stay on the sheet pan for 30 seconds before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with all of the dough. Store in an airtight container for up 10 days. If desired, you may scoop and freeze the cookie dough on a sheet pan and once frozen, place in a resealable bag to store. Bake directly from the freezer as above	48

Stir and allow to sit while you work on the next part.Combine the remaining water with the white sugar and the corn syrup in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a boil stirring frequently. Cover with a lid for exactly 2 minutes. (This gets all the sticking sugar from the sides.)Stick a thermometer in the pan and without stirring, bring the mixture to 240 degrees F or softball stage. Remove from the stovetop immediately.Slowly pour the hot syrup over the gelatin mixture while the mixer is on low speed. Once all of the hot syrup has been poured in, turn the mixer to high speed and beat for 12-14 minutes.Add in the vanilla extract and beat for one more minute.The bowl will get very full and the mixture will be thick, white, and shiny.Meanwhile, spray a 9 x 13 cooking sheet with sides with nonstick cooking spray (For thicker marshmallows, you can use a casserole dish). Combine the powdered sugar and cornstarch. Lightly coat the sides and bottom of the pan with the powdered sugar and cornstarch mixture.Using a lightly greased spatula, spread the mixture evenly on the pan. Lightly coat the top of the marshmallows with the cornstarch and powdered sugar mixture reserving the rest for later.Allow the marshmallows to cool and set up for at least 4 hours and preferably overnight.Then using small cookie cutters or sharp kitchen scissors, cut the marshmallows into small pieces and drop the pieces in the remaining cornstarch + powdered sugar mixture	36

8	Turtle Apples	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Turtle-Apples-538821.jpg	45	your apples with hot water so there's no residue on them. Otherwise the caramel will not stick as well.In a double boiler melt your caramel. Stir until smooth. Dunk the apple all the way in and swirl it around. Let the excess drip off. Place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Repeat till all the apples are coated. Stick in fridge for at least 30 minutes to set up.In a double boiler melt the chocolate and stir until smooth. Dunk the apple about halfway into the chocolate. Swirl then let the excess drip off. Place on a parchment lined cookie sheet.Now you need to add the pecans while the chocolate is still wet. I find putting the pecans on by hand easier. If you dunk you will end up with chocolate in your dunking bowl and ruin the pecans. They become hard to dunk if they are chocolate/pecan goop. So just turn the caramel/chocolate apples sort of on their sides, kinda diagonally and just drop the pecans as you sort of roll the apple around. Trust me, this works perfectly. You can also take the pecans and press them with your hand onto where you want them. It's messy but works also.Place them back on the parchment as you do each one	4

Add the garlic and chilies and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the capers, olives, and anchovy paste, and stir around to combine.  Add the tomatoes, toss to combine, cover, and cook, shaking occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked through and softened, about 10 minutes. Use a potato masher to roughly mash tomatoes. Add the shrimp, season to taste with salt and pepper, and cook just until opaque, 2 to 3 minutes (do not overcook). Add oregano and lemon zest and toss to combine	2

Drain the eggs, gently crack the shells against the side of the pan, and add enough cold water to cover them. Peel the eggs underwater, discarding the shells and adding the eggs to the cold pickling liquid. You want the storage container to be sufficiently narrow so that the eggs are submerged in the pickling liquid. Cover and refrigerate the eggs, letting them steep in the pickling liquid at least overnight and up to 7 days. (The longer you leave the eggs submerged in the pickling liquid, the flashier the hot pink color and the more pervasive it will be throughout the egg.)Make the honey-mustard mayo (optional)3. Pulverize the mustard seeds in a spice-devoted coffee grinder until finely ground but not powdery. In a food processor, combine the egg yolk, lemon juice, and water, and buzz to combine. With the machine running, begin to add the canola oil, drop by drop, until an emulsion forms.

With the mixer still on medium, add the sugar. Cream the butter and sugar together for 30-60 seconds on medium, until the two have been combined. Mix in the sea salt and almond extract.Add the flour all at once and take care to only mix the flour with the wet ingredients until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. The dough will be crumbly and that's perfect.Dump the crumbly shortbread out onto a big piece of plastic wrap and shape it into a rectangle. It should clump together smoothly. Refrigerate the dough for at least one hour, but two or three hours is better if you have the time.After the dough has chilled, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Once preheated, place the coconut on a sheet pan and place it in the oven, giving the coconut a stir every 5 minutes or so. The coconut can take between 5 and 15 minutes to take on color, and it's ready to be removed from the oven when it's a golden brown color.Lightly flour your countertop and roll the chilled shortbread out to about an 1/8 to 1/4 inch thickness. Use a cookie cutter to cut out shapes and place the cutouts on a baking sheet. Bake the cookies for 13-17 minutes, depending on how brown you like your shortbread. My husband likes soft shortbread with no color (13 minutes), and I like the shortbread golden brown and crisp (17 minutes). Let the cookies cool completely, then dip half the cookie in the chocolate and sprinkle it with the toasted coconut	1

Pour in the milk mixture along with the egg. Mix together to form a sticky dough, then turn out onto the work surface and knead until smooth and elastic (this will take about 10 mins). Put the dough into a lightly oiled bowl and cover with oiled cling film. Set the bowl in a warm part of the house and allow to rise for about 1 hr until doubled in size.Knock back the dough and divide into 12 equal portions. Cover the pieces with the oiled cling film while you make the rolls – this will stop the dough from drying out. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, roll out into a 30cm-long strand. Roll up one end into the middle, turn over and roll the other end into the middle, forming the dough into an S-shape. Place the buns on a large (or 2 smaller) parchment-lined baking tray. Once all the buns are made, lightly cover with oiled cling film and prove until almost doubled in size (if making ahead, keep the dough in the fridge overnight and bake in the morning).

Add the olive oil, lemon juice, white wine, soy sauce, harissa, mustard, and honey to the bag, combining the ingredients well.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Remove the backbone of the chicken by snipping down both sides of the spine with poultry shears, or taking a chef’s knife and cutting along both sides of it, and pulling it off. With the breast side down on the cutting board, take a knife and crack the bone between the breasts, then push the chicken down with your hands so it spreads out and lies flat. Flip the chicken over so it’s skin side up and press down with the heels of your hands on the chicken very firmly—like you’re giving it a shiatsu massage—to flatten it as much as you possibly can. Don’t go easy on it.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Loosen the skin from the breast and thigh meat and spoon some of the marinade under the skin. Put the chicken in the bag, close it securely, and use your hands to rub the ingredients into the chicken. Refrigerate it for 1 to 2 days, flipping the bag over a few times as it marinates.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            To cook the chicken, preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat on the stovetop and place the chicken in it, breast side down. Drape a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil over the top and set a heavy weight on top of it. A good option is a brick or a large saucepan filled with water.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Cook the chicken until the skin is a deep golden brown, which usually takes about 10 minutes or so—check it often. Once it’s browned, flip the chicken over, replace the weight, and let it cook for about 5 more minutes.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Remove the weight and the foil and place the chicken in the oven for 25 minutes, until it’s cooked through	4

Leave until bubbly, about 10 minutes.Stir together the flour, sugar and salt. Add half of the mixture to the yeast. Pour in the vegetable oil. Stir with a wooden spoon until the texture appears even. The dough will be very sticky at this point. Add the rest of the flour. Stir until the dough just comes together then dump onto a lightly floured work surface.Knead the dough for 10 to 15 minutes or until elastic and no longer sticky. Don’t be tempted to keep dusting the work surface with flour thinking that more flour will get the dough to the non-sticky stage. More flour and the dough will turn stiffer. Just keep kneading and you’ll get to the desired stage.Gather the dough into a ball. Lightly brush a large bowl with vegetable oil. Put the dough in the bowl, turning it every which way so that every part of the surface is coated with oil. Cover the bowl (cling film or a damp towel will do) and leave to rise until double in bulk, about one to three hours depending on the humidity.When the dough has risen sufficiently, punch down then transfer to a lightly floured surface. Knead for a couple of minutes then roll into a log about three inches in diameter. Cut into two equal portions. Cut each half into halves, and so on, until you have 16 pieces.Take a piece of dough, flatten to form a thin disc. Place the disc on your palm and place about two tablespoonfuls of filling at the center. Gather the edges, like pleating, until the top is closed.Place seam side down on a baking tray.

You won’t get a perfectly smooth top, trust me. It’s impossible.Let set while you are making the graham crackers.For the crackers, pre-heat oven to 350.Mix almond flour, honey, xanthan gum, and salt together. (I used my stand mixer, but a food processor might work even better!) The dough seems a little chunky, but don’t worry it will stick together.Roll out dough between two sheets of parchment paper to about 1/8-1/4 inch thickness.Cut into 2×2 inch squares (or whatever size you desire) and place on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. You might have to re-roll dough a few times after cutting out a few squares.Bake for 7-9 minutes (time will vary depending on thickness you chose, so keep an eye on them!). The crackers may seem a little soft when you take them out, but they will harden as you let them cool.Cool on wire rack for 10 minutes.While crackers a cooling, make your chocolate bars (if you aren’t using pre-made ones).Melt chocolate chips in the microwave or stovetop on low heat.Pour chocolate onto a baking sheet lined with parchment or wax paper. You can pour each piece individually, or just make one large bar and cut it after it freezes.Put in freezer for about 15 minutes to let harden, then cut into smaller pieces if necessary.Top graham cracker with marshmallow (I roasted mine over the stove-top to make it a little melty), then add chocolate and a scoop of almond butter	10

Roll dough into 1-inch balls, then roll balls 1 at a time in seeds to coat and arrange  2 inches apart on lined baking sheets. Bake, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until cookies are puffed and starting to crack, 12 to 15 minutes total. Cool on sheets 10 minutes (cookies will be very fragile when hot), then  transfer from parchment to a rack to cool completely.                                                Cooks' notes:            •For this cookie, it's best to use hulled sesame seeds, found at most supermarkets. They're not usually labeled "hulled"; look for sesame seeds that are pale ivory in color and more delicate than the mottled beige ones, which still have their outer coating and are found at natural foods stores and Asian markets.•Dough can be chilled up to 1 day.•Cookies keep in an airtight container at room temperature 5 days.•Luster dust is nontoxic. However, the FDA recommends that it be used for decorative purposes only.

Be sure not to over mix the ingredients.Place plastic or pastry bag into a cup to hold it straight. I would suggest a pastry bag, hence once you cut off the edge of a plastic bag it may not be a round shape. In this case, I wasn't going to make a trip to the store, so I did use a ziplock bag. Pour the entire mixture into the bag. Remove from the cup and twist to hold the batter in the inside.Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Pipe circles into the baking sheet, making them thick. Tap baking sheet at least 3 times on each side, this will get rid of any air bubbles and will prevent from cracks. Let macarons sit in room temperature for about 20 minutes, they will create a bit of a shell, also helps from cracks on top.Bake macarons at 300F for 13-20 minutes, depending on your oven. I would suggest checking them after 13 minutes or so. Place a spoonful of cream on a flat side of the macaron, enclosing it with another macaron over top	12

171	Chicago-Style Deep-Dish Pizza	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Chicago-Style-Deep-Dish-Pizza-507248.jpg	180	Make the Dough: Whisk together the flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl. Add water and melted butter and mix on low speed, using a dough hook, until fully combined, 1 to 2 minutes, scraping sides and bottom of bowl occasionally. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough is glossy and smooth and pulls away from sides of bowl, 4 to 5 minutes. (You can easily make this by hand, mixing in the water and butter with a spatula and then kneading by hand.)2. Coat a large bowl with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Using greased spatula, transfer dough to bowl, turning to coat the dough in oil; cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature until nearly doubled in volume, 45 to 60 minutes.3. Make the Sauce: While dough rises, heat the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until melted. Add onion, oregano, and salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated and onion is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes and sugar, increase heat to high, and bring to a simmer. Lower heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced to about 2½ cups, 25 to 30 minutes. Off the heat, stir in the basil and olive oil, then season with salt and pepper.4. Laminate the Dough: Turn the dough out onto dry work surface and roll into a 15x12-inch rectangle. Using an offset spatula, spread the softened butter over the surface of the dough, leaving a ½-inch border along the edges. Starting at the short end, roll the dough into a tight cylinder. With seam side down, flatten the cylinder into an 18x4-inch rectangle. Cut rectangle in half crosswise. Working with one half, fold into thirds like a business letter; pinch seams together to form ball. Repeat with remaining half. Return balls to oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise in refrigerator until nearly doubled in volume, 40 to 50 minutes. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 425 degrees F.5. Bake the Pizzas: Coat two 9-inch round cake pans with 2 tablespoons olive oil each. Transfer 1 dough ball to dry work surface and roll out into a 13-inch circle. Transfer dough to the pan by rolling the dough loosely around a rolling pin and unrolling into pan.

209	Featherlight Chocolate Cake	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/featherlight-chocolate-cake-740497.jpeg	75	Serving suggestion: Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve with milkArrange a rack in the upper 1/3 of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.Butter and flour a bundt pan or tube pan. (You can use a mixture of cocoa powder and flour instead of flour, to prevent white spots on the cake.)In a standing mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, or using a hand mixer, cream the butter until light and fluffy. Mix in the sugar. One at a time, mix in the eggs, then the vanilla, occasionally scraping down the mixing bowl.Meanwhile, in another bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon salt.Add 1/3 of the flour mixture; then 1/3 of the ice water. Repeat, mixing after each addition. Transfer the batter to the pan and bake until springy and dry, about 40 to 45 minutes.Let cool in the pan on a rack, then carefully turn the cake out. Just before serving, sift confectioners' sugar over the top. Serve with very cold milk!Notes about the recipe: When I developed this recipe I was just looking for a good, reliable dark cocoa cake that could sit on the counter over the weekend and be enjoyed in slivers, craving by craving. This cake is really moist and keeps for days. I just finished one that's been hanging around the kitchen for 6 days! You could frost it with creamy white icing but it hardly needs it. My friend Lana's mom June was one of the best cooks I knew as a kid in the '60s and she did a cake by the same name, though the recipe handed down to me from her daughter is a bit different	12

The mixture will be very thick, grainy, and difficult to stir at first.Keep cooking and stirring until it is smooth and glossy and starts to pull away from the sidesof the pan, 3 to 5 minutes.Transfer to a glass or metal mold and smooth the top.Let cool completely at room temperature.Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, until firm.Put the grains in a 1-quart glass jar and add water to cover. Place a double layer of cheesecloth over the mouth of the jar and secure it with a rubber band. Let the grains soak for 8 to 12 hours.Drain, then add just enough water to moisten the grains but not so much that they are immersed in water. Put the jar in a warm place out of direct sunlight for 1 to 3 days and rinse the grains once or twice a day, each time draining well and then adding just enough fresh water to moisten them.Continue this process until the grains have begun to sprout (they will have little tails emerging).Divide the sprouted grains equally between two 1-quart glass jars. Pour 3 cups of the filtered water into each jar. Cover each jar with fresh cheesecloth and secure it with rubber bands. Put the jars in a warm place out of direct sunlight for 1 to 3 days	3

248	Pumpkin Cinnamon Roll Pancakes	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Pumpkin-Cinnamon-Roll-Pancakes-517348.jpg	28	Prepare the cinnamon filling: In a small bowl- mix butter, brown sugar and cinnamon.  Whisk the filling ingredients together and then pour it into a sandwich-sized zip baggie.  Zip up the baggie and lay it on the counter while you prepare the pancake batter.2.  Prepare the Icing:  In a medium microwave-safe bowl, heat butter and cream cheese 30 to 60 seconds, just until butter has melted and cream cheese has softened.  Whisk in powdered sugar and vanilla and combine until smooth.  Set the icing aside.3.  Prepare the pancake batter:  In a large bowl, whisk together milk, pumpkin, eggs, oil, and vinegar.  In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, salt and brown sugar.  Add the dry ingredients to the pumpkin mixture and stir just until all is moistened.4.  Check on your cinnamon filling:  Open up the baggie again and give it a good stir to re-incorporate any butter that may have separated.  You want the mixture to thicken a bit- it's best when it's similar to the squeezing texture of toothpaste (which will eventually happen if you leave it on the counter long enough, but refrigerate for a few minutes if you need to).  Don't try to use the filling for the pancake swirl unless it has thickened as it will be too runny!  Snip off a small piece of the corner of the baggie. 5.  Cook the pancakes:  Preheat a large skillet or griddle to medium, and spray it with nonstick spray.  Use an ice cream scoop (or ladle) to add the batter to the pan.  Use the bottom of the scoop or ladle to spread out the batter into a nice, even circle. Reduce the heat to medium-low.  Pick up your cinnamon filling baggie and  squeeze the filling into the corner.  Starting at the center of the pancake squeeze the cinnamon filling on top of the pancake batter in a swirl (just as you see in a cinnamon roll).  Cook the pancakes 3 to 4 minutes, or until bubbles begin popping on top of the pancake and it is golden brown on the bottom.  Slide a thin spatula underneath the pancake and gently but quickly flip it over.  Cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes, until the other side is golden as well.  When you flip the pancake onto a plate, you will see that the cinnamon filling has created a crater-swirl of cinnamon.  Wipe out the pan with a paper towel, and repeat with the remaining pancake batter and cinnamon filling	8

Turn speed up to medium-high beating until the mixture forms soft peaks. Add the cornstarch mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, while the mixture is still beating. Continue to beat until stiff peaks, about 1-2 minutes.Remove filling from heat, whisk in the vanilla extract, then pour into the baked pastry shell.

Fill your canner with enough water to cover the jars by at least 1 inch and bring to a simmer. Using a pair of canning tongs, lower the jars in gently, tilting them to fill with the hot water. In a small saucepan, keep some water warm but not boiling; place the lids in the water. Have an additional kettle of water on to boil.Prepare the brine:Add vinegar, water, salt and garlic and peppercorns or honey (if using) to a medium saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to keep at a simmer.Prepare the jalapenos:Wearing latex or plastic gloves, slice the jalapenos into 1/4-inch rings. Add the rings to the brine and bring back to the boil.Fill and close the jars:Using canning tongs, remove the jars from the canner, carefully pouring the water back into the canner. Set next to the jalapenos in the saucepan. Turn the heat under the canner to high. Use a ladle to pour the jalapenos into the jars through a canning funnel, leaving 1/2-inch headspace at the top. Run a clean chopstick around the inside of the jar to dislodge any trapped air. Wipe the rims of the jars with a damp paper towel. Place the lids on, and screw on the rings until just finger-tight.Seal the jars:Using canning tongs, gently transfer the jars to the canner, taking care to keep them vertical. When all the jars are in the canner, there should be at least 1 inch water covering them; if you need more, add water from the kettle until the jars are sufficiently covered. Bring the water to a full rolling boil, and process for 5 minutes.Remove and cool:Using canning tongs, gently remove the jars from the canner and transfer them to a kitchen towel or cooling rack, again keeping them vertical. Do not set hot jars directly on to cool counter surfaces. Leave to cool, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours. If any of the jars do not seal when cool, reprocess using the method above, or refrigerate and use immediately.Label and store:Add a label to the lid or side of your jar, noting the date it was canned. Remove the rings and store jars in a cool, dark place for up to one year. Refrigerate after opening	2

Then, with a spatula (and plenty of arm strength!), fold in the chocolate chips and M&M's. Press into prepared pan and bake for 14 to 15 minutes. These bars are meant to be chewy, do not over bake! Cool completely on wire rack, then cut into bars.These bars are fabulous just the way they are, but if you want to add a little more festivity for the 4th of July, try adding chocolate frosting and sprinkles! I simply used a can of fudge frosting that I picked up in the baking aisle. Place frosting in a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip and swirl the frosting onto the top of each bar	48

Saute chicken, bell pepper and onions until browned, 6-8 minutes. Add the chili powder and cumin; cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Stir in tomatoes, beans and pepper.  Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes.  Place a tortilla in the dish and spoon in the chicken mixture down the middle. Roll into cylinder, place seam-side down in the dish.  Repeat with all tortillas. Depending on how full you like your enchiladas, you may have more chicken mixture left. I always do.  No need to waste it! Just spoon it over the top of the enchiladas.   Finally, sprinkle with cheese. Note: This is obviously where most of the fat comes from. This recipe is from the Weight Watchers cookbook, so they only recommend 1/2 cup of cheese (and the low-fat kind to boot), so if you are counting calories that’s an option. If you like cheese as much as I do, then you’ll probably just want to sprinkle enough cheese on top to cover the whole dish. More calories, obviously, but I think it’s worth it. Cover with foil. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until heated through, the edges are crispy and the cheese is melted. I find the less cheese you have, the less time it needs to cook; about 20-25 minutes if using the minimum amount of cheese, 25-35 minutes for more. Let stand 5-10 minutes before eating. Serve with some refried beans	2

301	Upside-Down Caramelized Apple Tart	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Upside-Down-Caramelized-Apple-Tart-599133.jpg	120	the pâte brisée1. Sift the flour onto a work surface and make a well in the center. Put the egg yolk, salt, and water in the well. Pound the butter with a rolling pin to soften it, add it to the well, and work the ingredients in the well with the fingers of one hand until thoroughly mixed. Using a pastry scraper, gradually draw in the flour from the sides of the well and continue working with both hands until coarse crumbs form. If the crumbs seem dry, sprinkle with another tablespoon of water; the crumbs should be soft but not sticky. Gently press the crumbs into a ball; the dough will be uneven and unblended at this point.2. To blend the dough, sprinkle the work surface with flour and put the dough on it. With the heel of your hand, push the dough away from you, flattening it against the work surface. Gather it up, press it into a rough ball, and flatten it again. This flattening motion evenly blends the butter with the other ingredients without overworking the dough. Work quickly so the butter doesn’t get too warm. Continue until the dough is as pliable as putty and pulls away from the surface in one piece, 1 to 2 minutes. Shape it into a ball, wrap, and chill until firm, 15 to 30 minutes. Pâte brisée may be refrigerated, tightly wrapped, for up to 2 days, or frozen for up to 3 months.Make the tarte3. Peel and halve the apples; scoop out the cores with a melon baller or the point of a paring knife.4. Melt the butter in the mold, sprinkle in the sugar, and cook over medium heat without stirring until it starts to brown and caramelize. Stir gently, then continue cooking until the caramel is a deep golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes total. Let cool in the pan for 3 to 5 minutes. The butter will separate, but this does not matter.5. Arrange the apples in the mold in concentric circles, with the cut sides standing vertically. The caramel will help to anchor them. Pack them as tightly as possible, as they will shrink during cooking. Cook the apples over medium heat until the juice starts to run, about 8 minutes, then raise the heat and cook them as fast as possible until the underside is caramelized to a deep gold and most of the juice has evaporated, 15 to 25 minutes.6. With a two-pronged fork, turn the apples one by one so the upper sides are now down in the caramel. Continue cooking until this second side is brown also and almost all the juice has evaporated, 10 to 20 minutes more. The time will vary with the variety and ripeness of the apples, and can take up to 1 hour total. Let them cool to tepid while heating the oven to 400°F (200°C).7. Roll out the pastry dough to a round just larger than the mold. Wrap the dough around the rolling pin and transfer it to cover the apples. Tuck the edges down around the apples, working quickly so the apples’ warmth does not melt the dough. Poke a hole in the center of the dough to allow steam to escape. Bake the tart until the pastry is firm and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.8. Take the tart from the oven and let it cool for at least 10 minutes, or until it is tepid. Tarte tatin may be made up to 12 hours ahead and kept in the mold in the refrigerator (if using a cast-iron skillet, the tart must be turned out immediately).9. To finish, if necessary, warm the tart in the mold on the stove top before you turn it out, to soften the caramel and loosen the apples. Select a flat platter with a lip to catch any juices; invert the platter on top of the tart pan and flip the tart onto the platter. Be careful because you can be splashed with hot juice	8

Brush asparagus with the olive oil. Grill 5 minutes in a dual-contact grill, 8-10 minutes in a regular grill, turning often, until just tender. Transfer to a plate.Poach the eggs: While asparagus is grilling, bring water to a boil in a large pot over high heat. Break each egg into a small bowl. Once water has boiled, reduce heat to medium-high to achieve a gentle boil. Add the vinegar to the water - this will help the egg whites congeal. Use a hand whisk to vigorously whisk the water, then slide the first egg into the resulting whirlpool. This will help the egg hold its shape when it first enters the water. Repeat with the second egg, then cover the pot, turn the heat off and set the timer for 5 minutes.When done, use a slotted spoon to lift the eggs out of the water and place them for a few seconds on a paper towel, to drain. Egg whites should be cooked-yet-creamy. Yolks should appear soft. When cut open, they should be thick but gooey.Wrap 3 asparagus spears in each slice of prosciutto. Arrange 2 of these bundles on each of your two serving plates and top with an egg. Sprinkle the eggs and the visible areas of the asparagus with salt and pepper	2

Reserve 4 pits. Take a large spoon and separate the avocado from its skin. You should have two large halves of clean, skinless avocado.If you have a masher, add the avocados to the bowl and mash together with the other ingredients. If not, roughly chop half of the avocado and add it to the bowl. With the second half, roughly chop again. With the back of your knife, smash the pieces of avocado against the cutting board until it becomes a coarse mush. This will be a little messy, but the result will be a great texture, smooth but not overly pureed.Using your knife, scrape all the avocado mush from the cutting board and add to the bowl. Mix together using a fork, and mix with additional large chunks of avocado until you obtain your desired consistency.Squeeze the remaining half a lime over the top and submerge the four pits just below the surface of the mixture.

Toss them into a colander as you go, sprinkling them generous with salt. When you're all done. let them sit in the colander for a good 30 minutes or more.Now set yourself up with lots of paper towels at the ready, and another colander or bowl. Take whole handfuls of the salted eggplant, lay it on a paper towel, then wrap up the eggplant chunks and gently squeeze to dry them as completely as possible. Drop the dried eggplant into the second colander. Repeat this procedure until you have used up all the eggplant.Fry the eggplant chunks in abundant oil until they are just lightly brown around the edges. The eggplant should be tender, but not meltingly so. Lay the fried eggplant out on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil.While the eggplant is purging per Step 2 above, cut the tomatoes into rough chunks, about the same size as the eggplant. Heat some olive oil in a skillet wide enough to hold them all in a single layer and toss in the garlic cloves. When the garlic is just beginning to give off its aroma (no more than a few moments) add the tomatoes and sauté them over a very brisk flame until they have cooked down. They will have melted into a kind of sauce, but with some chunkiness left in them. If you've made the tomato ahead of time, you can just let it rest off heat until you're need it.Add the eggplant to the tomatoes in the skillet. Mix everything together very gingerly to avoid turning the eggplant (which should be quite tender) into mush. If you have the skill, the best way is to toss the ingredients around in the skillet. If you're not up to that, then a spatula will do a more delicate job than a wooden spoon. Let the eggplant and tomatoes sauté over very brisk heat, tossing them from time to time, almost as if you were doing an Asian stir-fry, for a few minutes to let the flavors meld	4

409	Jalapeño Cheddar Bagels	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Jalapeo-Cheddar-Bagels-507687.jpg	240	To make the sponge, stir the yeast into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Add the water, whisking or stirring only until it forms a smooth, sticky batter (like pancake batter). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the mixture becomes very foamy and bubbly. It should swell to nearly double in size and collapse when the bowl is tapped on the countertop.2. To make the dough, in the same mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), add the additional yeast to the sponge and stir. Then add 3 cups of the flour and all of the salt and malt powder. Stir (or mix on low speed with the dough hook) until the ingredients form a ball, slowly working in the remaining ¾ cup flour to stiffen the dough.3. Transfer the dough to the counter and knead for at least 10 minutes (or for 6 minutes by machine). Add the Cheddar cheese and jalapeños during the last two minutes or so of kneading, and knead until evenly distributed. The dough should be firm, but still pliable and smooth. There should be no raw flour – all the ingredients should be hydrated. If you have an instant-read digital thermometer, the dough should register 77 to 81 degrees F. If the dough seems dry and rips, add a few drops of water and continue kneading. If the dough seems sticky or tacky, add more flour to achiever the stiffness required. The kneaded dough should feel satiny and pliable but not be tacky.4. Immediately divide the dough into equal pieces (each piece should weigh approximately 4½ ounces). Form the pieces into rolls.5. Cover the rolls with a damp towel and allow them to rest for 20 minutes.6. Line 2 sheet pans with baking parchment and mist lightly with spray oil. Proceed with shaping the bagels: Push a hole through the center of the roll with your thumb and stretch out the hole to 2½ inches in diameter, making sure that the resulting ring has a fairly even thickness all the way around.7. Place each of the shaped pieces 2 inches apart on the pan. Mist the bagels very lightly with the spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let the pans sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.8. Check to see if the bagels are ready to be retarded in the refrigerator by using the “float test”. Fill a small bowl with cool or room temperature water. The bagels are ready to be retarded when they float within 10 seconds of being dropped into the water. Take one bagel and test it. If it floats, immediately return the tester bagel to the pan, pat it dry, cover the pan, and place it in the refrigerator overnight (it can stay in the refrigerator for up to 2 days). If the bagel does not float, return it to the pan and continue to proof the dough at room temperature, checking back every 10 to 20 minutes or so until a tester floats. The time needed to accomplish the float will vary, depending on the ambient temperature and the stiffness of the dough.9. The following day (or when you are ready to bake the bagels), preheat the oven to 500 degrees F with the two racks set in the middle of the oven. Bring a large pot of water to a boil (the wider the better), and add the baking soda. Have a slotted spoon or skimmer nearby.10. Remove the bagels from the refrigerator and gently drop them into the water, boiling only as many as comfortably fit (they should float within 10 seconds). After 1 minute flip them over and boil another minute. While the bagels are boiling, sprinkle the same parchment-lined sheet pans with cornmeal or semolina flour. Sprinkle the bagels with the shredded Cheddar cheese as soon as they come out of the water.11. When all the bagels have been boiled and topped, place the pans on the two middle shelves in the oven. Bake for approximately 8 minutes, then rotate the pans, switching shelves and giving the pans a 180-degree rotation. (If you are only baking one pan at a time, keep it on the center shelf but still rotate 180 degrees.) After the rotation, lower the oven temperature to 450 degrees F and continue baking for about 8 minutes, or until the bagels turn golden brown.12	14

425	Marie-Hélène's Apple Cake	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Marie-Hlnes-Apple-Cake-206207.jpg	45	Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Generously butter an 8-inch springform pan and put it on a baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper and put the springform on it.                                                                Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in small bowl.                                                                Peel the apples, cut them in half and remove the cores. Cut the apples into 1- to 2-inch chunks.                                                                In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk until they’re foamy. Pour in the sugar and whisk for a minute or so to blend. Whisk in the rum and vanilla. Whisk in half the flour and when it is incorporated, add half the melted butter, followed by the rest of the flour and the remaining butter, mixing gently after each addition so that you have a smooth, rather thick batter. Switch to a rubber spatula and fold in the apples, turning the fruit so that it's coated with batter. Scrape the mix into the pan and poke it around a little with the spatula so that it's evenish.                                                                Slide the pan into the oven and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the top of the cake is golden brown and a knife inserted deep into the center comes out clean; the cake may pull away from the sides of the pan. Transfer to a cooling rack and let rest for 5 minutes.                                                                Carefully run a blunt knife around the edges of the cake and remove the sides of the springform pan. (Open the springform slowly, and before it’s fully opened, make sure there aren't any apples stuck to it.) Allow the cake to cool until it is just slightly warm or at room temperature. If you want to remove the cake from the bottom of the springform pan, wait until the cake is almost cooled, then run a long spatula between the cake and the pan, cover the top of the cake with a piece of parchment or wax paper, and invert it onto a rack. Carefully remove the bottom of the pan and turn the cake over onto a serving dish.                                                            Serving                The cake can be served warm or at room temperature, with or without a little softly whipped, barely sweetened heavy cream or a spoonful of ice cream. Marie-Hélène's served her cake with cinnamon ice cream and it was a terrific combination.                                                            Storing                The cake will keep for about 2 days at room temperature and, according to my husband, gets more comforting with each passing day. However long you keep the cake, it's best not to cover it — it's too moist. Leave the cake on its plate and just press a piece of plastic wrap or wax paper against the cut surfaces	8

Place a handful on a lightly floured surfaced to shape into a 4-inch square about 3/4 inch thick.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Cut the square from corner to corner twice to make four triangles. Repeat with the remaining dough to make as many scones as possible.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Mix the egg, kirsch, if using, and vanilla in a small bowl.Either quickly dunk each scone in the wash or use a pastry brush to dab the top and sides.

Heat the oven to 375 degrees and set a heavy ovenproof skillet (I like to use cast iron) over high heat. When the pan is hot, add the steaks and brown well on both sides, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the pan to the oven and continue to cook until the meat reaches desired doneness (it should take about 10 minutes for the internal temperature to reach 135 degrees, which is medium rare). Transfer the steaks to a plate and set in a warm place to rest, for at least 5, but preferably 10, minutes. Do NOT put the pan in the sink just yet!                                  Set the hot pan over low heat (make sure not to touch the handle and burn yourself!) and add about  cup water. Using a wooden spoon, scrape the bottom of the pan to get up all of the browned bits and stir to combine with the water. Set aside.                                  When you are ready to eat, slice the steaks across the grain into 1/3-inch slices. Reserve any juices that escape the meat. Arrange the arugula on a serving platter. Quarter the lemon. Drizzle a generous amount of good olive oil over the greens, followed by a generous squeeze of lemon juice, a liberal sprinkling of Maldon salt and several grinds of pepper. Lay the slices of steak on top of the greens, and then drizzle their juices and the fond from the pan over everything. Follow with another spritz of lemon and more pepper. Then use a vegetable peeler to top everything with a shower of parmesan curls	2

Lightly butter an 8x8-inch square baking pan, then line it with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on each side. Set aside.2. Using an electric mixer, beat together the butter and brown sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and mix to combine. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, reduce the mixer speed to low, and add the flour and graham cracker crumbs, mixing until a dough forms. Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and pat into an even layer (the dough will be rather soft). Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until light golden brown. Remove from the oven and place on a wire cooling rack.3. Make the Filling: Using an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the yolks on high speed until pale and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually add the condensed milk and beat until light and fluffy, an additional 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the lemon juice and beat on medium speed until combined, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. 4. Pour the filling over the crust and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the filling is set and the center does not jiggle when the pan is moved. Remove from the oven and place the pan on a wire rack to cool to room temperature. Once completely cooled, cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight.5. Make the Meringue Topping: In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup + 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, the water, and the corn syrup over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Once boiling, do not stir, and heat to 240 degrees F.6. Meanwhile, using an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form, about 1 minute. Gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar. If the sugar syrup has not yet reached 240 degrees, turn the mixer off and wait. Once the syrup reaches the correct temperature, turn the mixer speed to medium and add the syrup to the bowl in a slow, steady stream down the side of the bowl. Increase the speed to high and beat until thick, fluffy and cool, about 7 minutes. 7. Spread the meringue on top of the chilled lemon bar, swirling to form peaks. Using a kitchen torch, torch the meringue to a golden brown color. If you do not own a torch, you can place the pan in a 500 degree F oven for a few minutes to brown the top. Be sure to keep a close eye on it so it doesn't burn. Allow the meringue to cool, then slice into bars and serve	9

Set aside.In a small mixing bowl, stir the milk and vanilla together. Set aside.In a large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Tip: To cream, start by placing the butter in the bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed begin by beating the butter about 1 minute until it is smooth and light in color. With the mixer still on medium speed, slowly add the sugar to the butter, either one tablespoon at a time, or in a very slow steady stream, taking from 4 to 8 minutes to add all of the sugar, and beating until the butter and sugar are fully incorporated and the mixture is a light, or pale yellow color, with a fluffy texture. While adding the sugar, stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.Add eggs one at a time, beating until thoroughly mixed. Tip: For each egg, crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk with a fork to thoroughly break up the egg before adding to the creamed mixture. Start with the mixer on low speed so the liquid from the egg doesnt splatter, once the egg is partially mixed increase the speed to medium. Each egg should be fully incorporated into the mixture before adding the next egg, taking about one minute to blend in each egg.With the mixer on low speed, add about one third of the flour mixture, mix just until the flour is almost completely blended. Scrape the bowl down, and add about one half of the milk mixture, blending just until mixed. Scrape the bowl down again and continue alternating with the flour mixture and milk mixture, ending with the last portion of the flour, and stirring just until blended.Spoon the batter into the cupcake liners. Fill  full, using about  cup of batter per cup. Tip: Avoid over-filling the liners which may cause the batter to run-over the sides when baking. It is better to bake any remaining batter separately after the first pan of cupcakes has finished baking.Bake: Bake, rotating pan halfway through, 18 to 20 minutes, or until the cakes are just firm and spring back when gently pressed, and a toothpick, wooden skewer, or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool slightly in cupcake pan, and turn out of pan when cool enough to handle. Repeat process with any remaining batter. Cool cupcakes completely on a wire cooling rack before glazing and decorating.Sugar Glaze:In a medium bowl combine confectioners sugar, corn syrup, vanilla, and 4 teaspoons hot water. Add additional water if needed for a glaze consistency.Glaze one cupcake at a time. Dip the cupcake in the glaze, or use a small offset spatula and spread a thin layer of glaze over the top of the cupcake.As soon as each cupcake has been glazed, sprinkle with sanding sugars. Hold something with a straight edge, such as a stiff piece of paper, thin cardboard, or a clean ruler to mask two-thirds of the cupcake. Sprinkle the exposed one-third of cupcake with purple sanding sugar. Move the straight edge to cover the last one-third, and sprinkle the green sanding sugar in the middle section. Sprinkle the last one-third with yellow or gold sanding sugar	5

(If necessary, press each fig between two fingers before cutting to get two pretty halves.) Place the fig halves in a microwave-safe medium bowl and drizzle with lemon liqueur. Microwave on High until hot, about 30 seconds (or heat the figs in a small saucepan). Set aside for at least 15 minutes to soften.Beat yogurt, honey and lemon zest in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 40 seconds; scrape down the sides.

This is used to test the jam constancy later on.In a great big bowl, you're going to mix up the blueberries with the sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest. Allow to sit for a bit. While it's sitting, get your jars together and start preparing them.Prepare your jars for canning - I use a ball canning kit so I just followed the directions on the insert. I used two mason jars and 2 old small jelly jars I'd been saving for the photos. (seen in photo) Four Mason jars should work sufficiently for you. Depending on your canning equipment on hand, you might need to purchase a canning kit to properly prepare your jars for canning.In a small piece of cheese cloth, lay the basil leaves on top and smash, and slice them up a bit so they release their full flavor. Tie the cheesecloth closed with some kitchen twine or string.In a medium pot on medium heat on the stove, add the blueberry mixture and the basil cheesecloth package with the water.Heat the mixture to a boil.Once the mixture is boiling, mash the berries up so they are no longer chunky. You can use whatever you want to mash them, I just used the back of a spoon.You want the mixture to be much smoother. Don't hesitate to smash that bag of basil down into the blueberry either, just to get some more of that flavor in.Boil the entire mixture for about 20 minutes or so. Be sure and stir it up frequently so it doesn't stick and it's evenly cooked.At the end of 20 minutes, use a spoon to skim off the foam that collects on top. Remove as much as you can. It all has to go.Reduce your heat to a low simmer (make sure it's still bubbling) and continue skimming off the foam and stirring often until the jam thickens. If you don't stir often enough, and the jam begins to thicken, you will burn the jam. To get to the properly thickened stage, it took me to about the 45 minute mark but can take more than an hour to accomplish.Stir in the pectin at this point and stir well.You can now test the jam with the plate we put in the refrigerator.Grab the plate and plop a small spoonful onto the plate and then stick it back into the refrigerator for about a minute. Remove and tilt the plate a bit to the side. If the jam runs, it's not ready. It should stay right where it is. If it's not ready, continue cooking and stirring and add a little more pectin if needed, but often if you just give it a bit more time it will thicken and gel.When the jam is finally ready, remove the cheesecloth filled with the basil with a slotted spoon. You can throw this all away.Using a ladle with a spout, ladle the jam into your jam jars leaving about a ¼ inch of room between the jam and the top of the jar. Screw on the lids (be careful jars are VERY hot).Submerge them in rapidly boiling water for an additional 5 minutes.When they are done, remove them from the water and listen for the audible sound which will let you know they are sealed	4

Whisk to combine.  Pour the boiling water into the saucepan and allow to bubble for a moment then turn off the heat.  Pour the chocolate mixture into the bowl with the flour mixture and stir for just a moment to cool the chocolate.  Slowly add the egg mixture and stir until smooth.Pour the batter into the donut cavities, filling each no more than three-quarters full.  (I use a freezer bag with the corner tip cut off for cleanly piping the batter.)  Depending on the donut pan you have, you may need to work in batches as this recipe yields 2 to 2 1/2 dozen donuts.  Bake for 10 minutes.Remove from oven and let cool in pan for 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes, use a plastic knife to gently remove the donuts to cool completely on a wire rack.  Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  Stir in the cocoa powder until smooth.  Pour in the milk and vanilla, then stir in the powdered sugar.  Fold in the pecans.Once the donuts are cooled and the icing is somewhat cooled, layer a sheet of wax paper underneath the cooling racks holding the donuts. Using a spoon, slowly pour desired amount of icing over each donut and allow to drizzle over the sides.  The warmer the icing, the more it will drizzle, so wait another moment if it's too runny.  Try to strategically place the pecans on top of the donuts so they do not fall off.Allow to cool and icing to harden before serving.  Donuts will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for a day or two	24

You do not want to puree them or chop them too small, as the goal is to maintain some of their firm cranberry texture. At this point, place a small plate in the freezer so you can test the jam for proper thickness later.Add chopped cranberries to a deep, heavy-bottom pot and toss them with ¼ cup of sugar. Allow to sit for 1 hour. Stir in strawberries and let sit for another 15 minutes. Make sure your jars are sterilized and ready to go, and start a very large pot of water to boil on the stove for processing your filled jars. Keep the pot of water covered tightly.Mash the fruit slightly with a potato masher to break up the strawberries a bit. Add remaining ingredients to the pot with the fruit, stirring well to combine. Cook over medium heat until the fruit begins to bubble and spit furiously. (This is why you want to use a deep pot!) Skim off any foam that forms with a skimmer. Cook for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently to keep the jam from burning to the bottom of the pot.After 20 minutes, begin testing the jam. Spread a ½ teaspoon of cooked jam on the cold plate and set it back in the freezer. Wait 30 seconds, then run your finger through the jam. Is it thick enough to maintain the path made by your finger, or does it run all over the plate? If you’d like thicker jam, cook for another 4 minutes and test again. Repeat until the jam is as thick as you’d like, but don’t cook too long or you’ll drastically alter the taste of your jam.Working quickly, ladle jam into sterilized 8-ounce canning jars, leaving ¼ inch of head space. Carefully wipe the rims of the jars to remove any clinging jam before you screw on the tops and rings – only screw them to finger-tight or you will hinder the vacuum process that seals the jars. Process in the large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes to guarantee sterilization and to ensure a good seal.Fold a large towel in half and lay it on the counter. Carefully remove jars from hot water using a jar lifter and set them on the towel. Allow the jars to sit undisturbed until they’ve reached room temperature, ideally overnight. Make sure not to jostle or bump the jars while they are warm, lest you break the seal. After a while, you’ll notice a very satisfying “ping” sound coming from the jars as the vacuum sets and the indentation on the lid pops inwards	4

Line 2 baking sheets with a silicone nonstick baking mat or parchment paper. If using parchment, lightly coat the paper with nonstick cooking spray or butter. Have a couple of muffin tins at the ready.2. Write fortunes on long strips of sturdy paper. (The paper can be fancy or plain, it matters little. Best stick with strips that are 3 1/2 to 4 inches long and no more than 1/2 inch or so wide.)3. Stir together the butter, vanilla, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves.4. Beat the egg whites and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed for about 1 minute. Reduce the speed to low, add about half of the flour, and beat just until combined. Switch to a spatula and gently fold in the butter mixture. Add the remaining flour and fold just until combined.5. Drop 1 tablespoon of the batter onto the baking sheet and use the back of a spoon to spread the batter evenly and very thinly into a 3 1/2-inch circle. Repeat to make 3 or 4 cookies on each baking sheet.6. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes, until the fortune cookies just barely begin to brown around the edges. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for about 30 seconds and then, working quickly, transfer the cookies from the baking sheet and place them on a clean dish towel. Place a fortune just above the center of each cookie and fold the cookie in half, pinching the top of the curved portion to seal. Gently bend the ends of the fortune cookie together to form a fortune cookie shape. (Fold the cookie over a chopstick, if you have one, to help create the bend in the center.) Place the cookie in the muffin tin, bended side down, to help it retain its shape while it cools. Repeat with the remaining cookies. Hurry!)7. Melt the chocolate in a glass bowl or measuring cup. Dip half of each fortune cookie in the melted chocolate	18

Cut the cords into short lengths.Take each little piece of dough, one by one, and quickly rub them between your palms in a circular motion to form little balls, the smaller the better. Place the little balls on a floured towel as you work, making sure that they are all in a single layer so they don't stick. Just before proceeding to the next step, you grab the ends of the towel and swish the balls around to lightly flour them.Heat lots of oil in a large pan. When the oil is nice and hot, but not boiling, plunge the dough balls into the oil a handful at a time. The oil will immediately bubble up vigorously.Fry the dough balls until they are lightly browned. Drain on paper towels while you proceed to the next step.In an ample sauté pan or saucier large enough to hold all of the dough balls, gently heat the honey until it liquifies. Add the dough balls, stir them gently to coat. Allow the balls to soak up the honey for just a minute or two.

Place it in the pan and cook on the first side until it begins to brown on the bottom and it begins to bubble and puff, about 1-2 minutes.                                                                                                                            6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Turn the flatbread over and cook on the second side for another 30-60 seconds until it browns a bit on the second side. It's fine it it's spotty from cooking on the "bubbles." Sometimes you'll have a lot of smaller bubbles, and sometimes the bubbles will combine and the whole flatbread will puff like a balloon.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            As each flatbread is done, stack them and cover them with a clean kitchen towel to keep them warm as you cook the rest	8

For a gas grill, turn off half of the burners. Put the onion in a small bowl and cover with cold water; let soak 20 minutes, then drain and squeeze dry. Meanwhile, pulse 1 cup basil, the avocado, garlic, crema and the juice of 1 lime in a blender or mini food processor until smooth; season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.Tie the beef tenderloin in 2-inch intervals using kitchen twine. Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil, the cumin, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a small bowl. Brush the oil mixture all over the beef and transfer to the grill over direct heat. Grill, turning occasionally, until the beef is well marked, about 15 minutes. Transfer the beef to the cooler side of the grill (indirect heat) and continue grilling, turning occasionally, until a thermometer inserted into the center registers 125 degrees F for medium rare, 15 to 20 more minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.While the beef is cooking over indirect heat, cut a small slit down the center of each plantain and lightly brush the skins with olive oil; transfer to the grill over direct heat. Grill, turning occasionally, until the skins are charred and the plantains are soft, about 20 minutes; cut into thirds.Meanwhile, roughly chop the remaining 2 cups basil; toss with the watermelon, the remaining lime juice and 2 tablespoons olive oil, the cheese, aje peppers and onion in a medium bowl.

While the peaches are macerating, make the topping: Combine oats, flour, sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in a small bowl. Add butter and combine using a pastry blender or your fingers (fingers work best). The topping should be in bits and chunks. [Note: The topping can be made in advance. Just refrigerate, covered, until ready to use.]4. Make the filling: Drain peaches in a colander set over a bowl to catch the peach juice. Whisk ¼ cup of the drained peach juice with the cornstarch, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, light brown sugar, and salt.

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. 2 large sliced potatoes are usually too crowded on 1 sheet, but it depends on their size. You may need an additional sheet. Set aside.Wash and peel the potatoes. Cut off the ends. With a verysharp knife, cut the potatoes into thin slices about 1/4 inch wide. Place in a large bowl or ziplock bag and toss with cornstarch. You want a nice thin coating. Pour the potatoes into a strainer to get rid of any extra cornstarch. Discard the extra cornstarch out of the mixing bowl too. Place potatoes back into the bowl and add the melted coconut oil. Toss to coat. Mix together 1/3 granulated sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Pour cinnamon sugar over sweet potatoes and toss to coat.Line the coated sweet potatoes onto the baking sheet. Try not to crowd them or else they won't bake, they'll just steam. Bake for 15-18 minutes. Remove from the oven and flip. Place back into the oven for 10-15 more minutes. Make sure to rotate the pan to avoid uneven browning. Dont fret if the edges are a little brown, they will taste more caramelized than burnt. **It's expected for the oil and cinnamon/sugar to create a glaze on the baking sheet and on top of the fries.Turn the oven off and keep the fries inside as the oven cools down for about 30 minutes. This step will help the fries get crispier. You may not have time to keep them in the oven for an additional 30 minutes as it cools, so its not mandatory. No matter what you do though, some fries will still be on the soft side. Sweet potatoes are packed with moisture.Remove fries from the oven and place in a large bowl. Combine the remaining 1/3 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and pour over fries. Toss gently to coat.Serve with vanilla glaze dip. For the dip, simply whisk all of the ingredients together. I usually start with 2 Tablespoons of the cream and add 1 more if it seems too thick	2

737	Homemade Cookie Butter Peanut Butter (with vegan and gluten-free options)	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Homemade-Cookie-Butter-Peanut-Butter-(with-vegan-and-gluten-free-options)-520634.jpg	45	peanuts to the canister of a food processor, process on high power until creamy and smooth, about 5 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the canister if necessary however I find the less scraping and interruptions, the better. The peanuts will go through stages of: crushed, crushed into a fine powder, a paste, a thicker paste, a big “dough ball”, and then the ball will break down into runnier peanut butter. At the point the peanut butter is runny, continue processing for about 1 to 2 more minutes, making sure the peanut butter is as smooth as desired. Add the ginger cookies, cinnamon, vanilla, and process for 1 to 2 minutes, or until smooth and incorporated. I add the cookies whole through the feed tube but if using a weaker or older food processor, crumbling the cookies in your hand first and sprinkling them in may prevent your machine from struggling. Add the white chocolate and blend until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. I've made this with up to 2 cups white chocolate and at 1 cup, it's not discernible but at 2 cups it is more so. Transfer spread into a glass jar or other container with a lid.  Store spread either in the refrigerator or at room temperature. At room temperature it firms up some but stays soft. In the refrigerator, because of the white chocolate, it does harden but softens up again after ten minutes at room temperature. I estimate that it could be stored at room temperature for at least two weeks without issue, but with anything, let common sense be your guide. In the refrigerator it will keep for months. The shelf life at either room temp or in the refrigerator will far exceed your willpower and I fine longterm storage issues to be moot. Recipe can be kept vegan and gluten-free by using regular roasted peanuts rather than honey roasted, gingersnaps that are vegan and gluten-free, and vegan white chocolate	18

Using the cookie scoop, spread the chocolate out as best as you can, it doesn't have to completely cover the bottom of the cupcake liner.Then, add 1/2 Tbsp of the biscoff butter filling on top the chocolate. Using a regular spoon, spread the biscoff out over the chocolate and smooth the top as best as you can. Using the cookie scoop, top the filling with 1 tsp of melted dark chocolate. Using a combination of a regular spoon and gently rapping the cupcake tin on the counter, spread out and smooth out the top layer of chocolate.Refrigerate the cookie butter cups for at least a few hours. To store them, leave the cookie butter cups in the liners and store them inside an airtight container in the refrigerator.Tips:I used Biscoff brand spread. You can use your generic store brand cookie butter too!I used Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips but I'm sure any other brand dark chocolate chips or bars would work.A cookie scoop is a good idea for this recipe because using a teaspoon measuring spoon or a regular spoon, it will be hard to get the chocolate off	18
